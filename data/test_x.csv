Damn. Apparently Arya was to be quite the little heartbreaker...
"The insect was a manticore. Manticores have a poisonous sting that is fatal to humans and kills the instant it reaches the heart, unless a clotting agent is used to thicken it and delay its fatal effects. As far as the nonsense with the creepy little girl, I dunno. Apparently it had something to do with the warlocks and their magic. Nothing like that was ever in the books. A sorrowful man (the Sorrowful Men are a Qartheen group of assassins) does try to kill Dany with a manticore in the books, but it is while she is still in Qarth, where access to manticores is much easier, since they live on islands in the Jade Sea."

Then Ned drafting his Last Will, who makes some very subtle alterations, then Robert pleading to Ned to help Joffrey before he came of age,  saying he wasn't a good father to him.  He blamed HIMSELF for how fucked up Joffrey was.

"But you're generalizing all people together. You're clubbing all Stannis fans into the anti-Dany group. I like them both. In fact, I only started supporting Stannis because there used to be so much hate against him. Same way Sansa became one of my favorites. A few years back, forget the rest of the internet, even right here on reddit, people wanted both Stannis and Sansa to die.

It's just recently that the anti-Dany fans have gotten more aggressive, because of the show, and since they need someone else to support, they decided to support Stannis since he was the only available alternative. But that doesn't mean supporting Stannis means one automatically hates Dany.

There are legitimate reasons to like and dislike both Daenerys and Stannis, but the militant anti-Dany and anti-Stannis people are making it seem like it's two very different sides that always hate each other. Most people don't actually hate her. There are always bad eggs that ruin it for everyone."

"He's pretty awesome, and I'd like to see him again, but the royalty potential is incredibly low, since if Stannis legitimized him, Gendry would come before him, so he wouldn't do that. He would be a competitor for Tommen, a new Daemon Blackfyre, so Cersei wouldn't let Tommen do that either.

"Sorry, but that is just shit to me. Rape is a part of the world George created and has been in the show from season 1. Now it happend to Sansa and all of sudden it is a big deal. Theon got tortured for god knows how long. Even his penis is removed. Didn't hear a lot of people (and especially woman) crying about that. 

I hope we will see some more rape, just for this whinig."
True. Things might be different had Bran listened to his mum/kept his promise about not climbing.

"The show is very inconsistent with troop numbers. In a  conversation Littlefinger had with Tywin he said that the Starks and the Lannisters had larger armies than the Tyrells. But Renly still had 100 000 men and Stannis' army at the Blackwater had to be around the size of 20 000 men because he came to King's Landing with 200 ships. So more than 80 000 of Renly's men were from the Reach, which is a much larger force than either the Lannisters or the Starks can muster."

"[ADWD spoilers and heavy speculation](#g ""Young Griff is revealed to be Aegon, the Targaryen son of Rhaegar who was apparently not killed as an infant.  He's been raised in hiding and trained to be a king in order to take back the Crown.  He's the one Tyrion meets on his way to Dany.  There's also a theory that he's a Blackfyre Targaryen who's been told he's Aegon, which honestly makes more sense than real-Aegon suddenly being alive.  I think pairing Sansa and Aegon is a strangly too-good-it-must-be-fiction type of match, given their ages, backgrounds, and the fact one's been setup/trained by Littlefinger and the other Varys.  Having them end up on the throne together makes for a very stable political Crown that would bring a believable peace to Westeros like really nothing else would.  Even Dany and her dragons burning everyone into submission is a short-term peace.  There's no evidence there will ever be other dragons, and the public will not love her like they can Sansa.  Aegon brings all of the Targaryen heritage to the table like Dany, but his education is far more important long-term than the dragons.  He should end up on the Throne.  How the show's going to handle all that I have no idea.  They've simplified a lot of characters down, and if they've changed/merged Aegon we'll hopefully see it this season."")

Yeah I've read that argument a lot.  The problem with it is that it's been months since Dany freed them.  It's unrealistic that a group of fighters proud of their ""best in the world"" identity would just never train again, especially when they're still working as soldiers.  Anyone needing extra training would have received it in those months.  

Then for the sake of argument, pretend there's still a block of Unsullied who are terrible fighters and can barely hold their spears.  It's also terribly unrealistic for all of them to be patrolling the city together.  At the very least they would be split up so only one untrained person would work with others for both safety and training.  That group was also led by Grey Worm, who it's safe to assume would have ""some"" idea how to set up a safe and effective patrol group.

I actually think he was thinking about Brienne when he said it. I don't think Cersie ever loved Jaimie the way he loved her. She is indeed a hateful woman.

"It works better in the books because Cersei is the only POV character there, and she's the source of all the tension.  No matter how much you might dislike her, just the fact that you're reading it from her point of view while she claws and scrapes to hang onto what power she has left makes it play out as tense."

"In A Game of Thrones, Dany prays to members of the Seven and also to the Dothraki's horse god. She's a young girl without any nuanced or set faith."
I thought of that being because of how many times Ramsay gave him hope for something good and then turned around and tortured him even worse if he went along.  It's what trains him to assume that any hope must be a trick.  We see the first example when he thinks Ramsay's helping him escape and leads him right to the torture chamber instead.  And we see how it works out in his mind when his sister tries to break him out and he won't go along.
I wish I could say this ;P Have fun watching!

"And Littlefinger did most of his work with Lannister and Arryn/Tully ""papers"".

"I remember back when people were genuinely predicting stuff, it was the upvotes that gave it away."
Nope. Never by that nmae.
Tywin saying it one time doesn't make the line meaningless. He said it for that particular context.
The flaying of the Ironborn increased his ruthless image and ensured that there were no people to spread the word of Theon's capture.
"So do I, m--m'lord."
"That is what I though, but they where the only north bastards I could think of. So it was more a question like ""Why Jon and Ramsay, how?"""
The very first one was this season with the random red priest in Volantis. The only time in the books that people from Yi Ti are encountered (would be played by Asian actors on-screen) is when Dany is in the Western Market of Vaes Dothrak.
"What has Brienne done in the show that it better than everything she does in A Feast for Crows? Rorge, Biter, Nimble Dick, Hyle Hunt, Randyll Tarly, Septon Meribald, the elder brother, the gravedigger, Shagwell, LSH, Jaime at Pennytree, Tymeon, Pyg, Gendry.. Come on, dude. Just my opinion."
"Ah, good point. Let's hope so. But, I wouldn't be surprised if they just cut that entire plotline (especially since Jaqen is in Braavos instead of Oldtown) and ""streamline"" it so that Sam just continues his studies at the wall.

Either way, I will miss rum-barrel-Aemon."
"Doran will probably just arrest all four of them after their failed attempt at assassinating Myrcella in the Water Gardens. Then.. yeah, that's it. After that, we'll probably just see scenes with Myrcella and (Quentyn? I forgot which one this is). And probably two more scenes with the Sand Snakes/Ellaria in jail.  "

Keep in mind that Cersei believes that Sansa played a part in Joffrey's murder.
"[Book Spoilers, sorta.](/b ""Maybe not a beast, but definitely a squealer. Roose says he finds the noises she makes in the sack 'quite charming.'"")

Walda's very well set up, if you have expectations appropriate for the society rather than applying our expectations to it.  So she and Roose aren't very emotionally close and her husband has all of the emotional range of a great white shark.  She don't care, that's kind of the norm (especially if you grew up a Frey).  She's the Lady of Winterfell, wife to the Warden of the North.  You can count on one hand the number of people with a higher social position than her in all of Westeros.  Walda has *nothing* to complain about.

That is, until/unless Ramsay starts murdering her babies..."
Hizdahr doesn't sound like Tyrion in this episode.
I fell in love with a show that didn't hold back for fear of offending the viewer.
Right? It's flawless. Whoever made this really went the extra mile. Even the lighting matches perfectly.

What did AudioSly spoil?
"It was never actually revealed in the books either yet, as you realize."
A ballista on some type of swivel device that could also be cranked up and down.
"Well, my top three favorites who have absolutely nailed every single scene they've been in would be:

Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister)

Diana Rigg (Lady Olenna Tyrell)

Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister)

But the *best* actor on the show? Hands down, that would be Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy / Reek). How on earth does one act that *broken*? His portrayal of Reek just blows me away, every time (dear gods, the eyes...). A truly stunning performance from an incredible actor."
"&gt; (not just Tywin)

"
"""angles"""
"Sort of, maybe kinda.  I mean technically yes, but some people might not agree and those people might back one of those kids to try to fight him for the succession.  If Ramsay wants to make sure his inheritance is *certain,* then he'd want to kill those kids."
"&gt; There's a bear in the episode?

A bear there was, a bear, A BEAR!"
But a murder or a thief is usually not rich and have no gold for a good fighter. 
"It can still happen. I remember the Purple Wedding episode's synopsis being something like: ""Joffrey and Margaery have breakfast."""
Yup

What would the spoil? Like you can't spoil anything in Game of Thrones.
But the Reach people still believe in the Seven.
"True, let's hope he will break at one point. "
"Fuck, even Renly wouldn't allow it."
"I assume you mean in time to bring Jon back?  Since the show went out of the way to note the Lord Commander ordering for Jon, it seems very likely it'll follow the same pattern predicted in the books, where Jon will stay dead for a while, long enough that another Lord Commander will be named (999th) so that when Jon finally does come back he can get selected as the 1,000th Lord Commander.  It also ties in with the whole ""ghost"" foreshadowing with his direwolf's name (like all the kids).  And since he should stay dead-n-warged for ""a while,"" Mel doesn't need to be there for any of that.  She just needs to show up later whenever it's time for him to be raised/reborn."
"As much as I would *hate* to see this happen, I would *love* to watch the fallout from it..."
The Dornish subplot could certainly use a flamethrower guitar.
"Yeah, it was kinda the point.

:((("
Tommen will activate Joffrey-mode.
Gotcha. Thx for the reply.
Doreah died in the Red Waste.
"What else in Episode 10 would blow the fans' minds? The Walk of Shame? Nah. Kevan and Pycelle's assassination? Probably not. Arya and/or Dany sailing back to Westeros? Not really. LS? I think that ship has sailed. The only thing other than ""For the Watch"" that would blow the fans' minds would be something crazy happening in Winterfell like Stannis being killed."
Very much so. I can't believe we haven't seen Nymeria since the first season.
