author,body
Craftlords,"He knows probably that he was Theon, but ... I have no idea how to describe this. He knows, but he doesn't want to know. Or something like that"
Craftlords,"I've tried saying Reek and p(r)ick on many ways, don't get them to rhyme?"
Craftlords,Lol. That would not even make a little bit sense.
Craftlords,"Didn't read the books, but why would the ex slaves hate her. They can volunteer if they want and watch if they want and don't come near there if they want."
Craftlords,Season 5 is good.
Craftlords,It's like the Purge in real life.
Craftlords,What a cool kid!
Craftlords,"2,5 million viewers lost from episode 1 S5 untill now? "
Craftlords,"If I'm correct the story goes that Varys killd Tywin. She also knows about Jorah's loyalty even though he betrayed her. I just don't see it happening Tyrion and Dany. Although it would be very funny and kind of awesome it just... Nah, don't work for me ;s"
Craftlords,"Have you seen the review for episode 8 yet? The wildlings aren't like ""Hey Jonnie, let's be friends!"". So most likely there will be white walkers and they will fight together and become kind of mates. At least that is how I see it happening."
Craftlords,With the children. 
Craftlords,"I haven't read all the books yet and I didn't really know what happend. You see him walking in a tower and then... Ramsay sitting there. From that point of view two things are possible. I didn't think Theon would help her in the first place so I had a feeling, but didn't know for sure."
Craftlords,At this point Stannis.
Craftlords,I see more people write his name like that. Just wtf? How hard can it be xD
Craftlords,I'm with you ;D
Craftlords,dravirys
Craftlords,"That has nothing to do with the keyboard, but with the computer itself ;) But my computer doesn't autocorrect my mistakes? They show it with a red line (like in word), but don't correct it. So maybe you can google how you can turn that off?"
Craftlords,"Just 10 episodes that is what I think about it. I have seen season 1,2,3 and 4 is less then 2 months so that where some intense months xD But now it is just 5 more episodes :(But I love this show!"
Craftlords,"Still doesn't know? The old lady got killed in the last episode and we see Brienne short after that standing and watching over Winterfell. I don't think there would be days of time difference in between those moments, irght?"
Craftlords,"Of course not, but however he is the king and there where guards. So if he just said ""Stop those fools"" then his guards would stop them."
Craftlords,"I do love Ser Friendzone more. I assume you mean Jorah, right?"
Craftlords,And funny as hell ;D But serious seeing those 2 guys (Tyrion and Jorah) together is really great. Even though Jorah isn't a very big part of the story I am in love with that guy!
Craftlords,Had a good laugh about your comment ;P
Craftlords,This is serious the most asked question this whole season. People google something before asking?
Craftlords,"Nver had much with Lol, but this gave the last push xD"
Craftlords,You can't be serious right? xD
Craftlords,"Attack? No. LOL did someone said that? He just had to do something, stop them."
Craftlords,Me too... looks really really weird..
Craftlords,And a bit of murder spread over it. 
Craftlords,"No, nobody thinks that. That is why it has been mentioned 100 times ;)"
Craftlords,"I am feeling the same way. However I loved how shit got down for her last episode, but I like her more as 'queen'. "
Craftlords,I have seen him saying that too. And if that was the scene then that doesn't seems right to me. Just hyping it all up.
Craftlords,"Gosh I am not the only one. Ramsay was just a fucked up guy in the last seasons, but now the story and his scenes are pretty interesting."
Craftlords,But you can read the same book at the 'same time'. Use two bookmarks and when you are working your wife can read etc? But you won't regret reading them ;D I started with the first one too and although it was an amazing book it took quite a while. But the second and third book did go so fast! Now book 4 will arrive today :D
Craftlords,"I was never really sure about him, mostly because of the Red priest. But this season he has really been growing on me. I like him and he could be a very good king, but like you said..."
Craftlords,"Not really. Don't show weakness or that people could fuck with you. It shows who is the boss. It wasn't needed in this situation, but you never know. Look at Cersei last episode leaving her guards, because she tought the High Septon was harmless."
Craftlords,I found that one strong argument.
Craftlords,"Maybe, but I think we could end with a Kingslanding destroyed and whole Westeros gone to shit."
Craftlords,Somsthing wrungÂ¿
Craftlords,Everyone hated that movie ... just everyone.
Craftlords,What a great episode. Maybe even the best so far this season! 
Craftlords,"Next to Joffrey, she likes him. But I don't think she loves him."
Craftlords,"""She actually wants to fuck this brons out."" Aha, I'm a genius..."
Craftlords,"House Reek: ""We don't fuck around!"""
Craftlords,That would even be fucked up for Game of Thrones.
Craftlords,Yep this guy has a new background! I haven't seen this either how could I have missed this! My king my Jorah ;D Thank you very much for showing this it's wonderfull!
Craftlords,But do they cast for every single character this way? Isn't there a change they do some calls with actors?
Craftlords,"Her oath was also protecting her king, which died because of Stannis. And she takes that very serious, but if it comes to a chose she should go for Sansa.."
Craftlords,"Well you aren't a Game of Thrones super nerd fan if you stop watching the show after a scene like this. Didn't she saw the brains from Oberyn? Didn't she saw Theon got tortured for god knows how long? Has she even paid attention from the beginning? Where Dany got raped too. I haven't seen this (I will), but I already hate those woman."
Craftlords,No good answer.
Craftlords,They don't deserve all the hate they get simple as that.
Craftlords,"""It's insane how people think **Tommen** should have attacked the Faith Militant"""
Craftlords,I need some good HD screencaps from this kind of views for my background. I now have Tyrion and it's getting old ;P
Craftlords,"I feel so bad for them too, because they know all this hate. It isn't like a few people don't like them. Just serious all of the fans are hating on them. But they got there money either way, which is nice ;D"
Craftlords,I just hope you are joking.
Craftlords,I love those little things ;P
Craftlords,Let's just hope it is.
Craftlords,"You really haven't been paying attention, didn't you?"
Craftlords,I think I'll do a 'recap' of the North. So the first one will be in that one. And I'll use Bronn for sure xD
Craftlords,"It isn't that much? A few(er) more episode wouldn't hurt, but I haven't catched up with the books and I can easily follow everything that is going on."
Craftlords,"Yep, I am going to watch this movie!"
Craftlords,Is she kills Jorah I am done xD He can't die! Hopefully Tyrion will do some good words!
Craftlords,Well that is a very good reason to go watch that movie.
Craftlords,"I think reading the whole story is more my thing, but thanks tho :P"
Craftlords,Wasn't it 4 weeks?
Craftlords,"Well he is alive, but no Theon anymore ;S "
Craftlords,Not that they never did it before ^^ But I just knew it. 
Craftlords,Those free man fighting in the pits &lt;3
Craftlords,I love littlefinger ;D I can't understand people don't like him!
Craftlords,"Yes, but probably some big death(s) ;D"
Craftlords,"True, let's hope he will break at one point. "
Craftlords,"""Lets give him one fight scene and get rid of that guy"" writers Got."
Craftlords,You didn't...
Craftlords,"""Oh no, the bloody Bolton bastard boy is bothered by the b word. That's blissfully brilliant."" That is the best part ;D"
Craftlords,"Don't we all agree that these are the kind of discussions we need here, and not that 'thing' from last episode? ;3"
Craftlords,"I am playing the second episode so quite a lot to catch up. But as far I have seen there are no 'game changing' choices, but definitely choices where you have to think about. And I don't know how it is going to turn out, but I let one of the characters wrote a letter which could have a different turn then those who didn't. Also the (sword) fighting is really great and you have crossbows ;D"
Craftlords,"Thx! I had that one, because I just love Bealish ;)"
Craftlords,"Greyscale is what Shireen, Stannis Daughter, has too. She got a lot of help from maester that came from all sides of the world. The stoneman (attacked Tyrion and Jorah) do have it. More you should just google ;)"
Craftlords,And she does look cute too while I though she was quite ugly in the show xD
Craftlords,"A digital painting is a painting. It's the same thing, but different material is used. And then I am talking about the people who really work with those drawing tablets (or even a mouse) and don't use photo's and put it all together. Look at some timelapse on Youtube. And look at a few comics, most of them are made digital too.

Although I agree with you that a painting like this is way more impressive then a digital one ;D"
Craftlords,That would be a really good episode name for the finale.
Craftlords,"Don't you remember, they are dead Hodor killed them ;D They aren't in this season, because they where going to fast with there story I though."
Craftlords,He said it in the episode: Pirates won't go near that place.
Craftlords,I know right!
Craftlords,"He isn't fucking, that's for sure."
Craftlords,He is such an amazing character in the books! 
Craftlords,"Jorah is a good man, I hope he will get some respect from his cruch before his time is over ;("
Craftlords,"This is serious a big deal for people? Come on get your shit together. YOU ARE WATCHING GAME OF THRONES! We have seen a brains all over the floor, we have seen rape scnes with naked body's. And now you get a scene like this an it is al to much. For a show like Game of Thrones it was more to less."
Craftlords,Your forgot her brother? Not all the Targaryens are like Dany. 
Craftlords,They just showed it in the episode trailer. They where just done with that guy somehow.
Craftlords,And people are saying that Dany never got raped. 
Craftlords,All the other season didn't air on Memorial Day. They skipped a week.
Craftlords,"So if she doesn't become the queen her story would have been for nothing? Isn't that the point of Game of Thrones? You win or you die... there is no middle ground. Robb didn't became the king in the North, now his whole story is a worthless pile of shit?  Stannis a perennial loser? I kind of understand why (I assume you only watch the show) showwatchers don't have something with him. Atleast he was not boring for me, but I would chose someone else. But then I read the first 3 books and now with this season: Stannis is the Mannis! He is the rightfull heir and would be a very good king. Respectfull and fair. "
Craftlords,"I would rather see Tommen do something about it, but for now I don't think he would even make it till the end of this season ;S"
Craftlords,"Because different opinions, I guess?

At first I liked Brans story, but it got a bit dull for me. "
Craftlords,Why would she marry him?
Craftlords,"They where a bit fast with his story, faster then the books I though. So he won't be in this season as far I know."
Craftlords,"I don't think they did show that, but it would be more then normal that they get paid. Oberyn hadn't a reason to get paid, because he probably didn't need money and came to kill the Mountain. But would you give your life for a thief? For nothing? Don't see that happening."
Craftlords,You pirate!
Craftlords,Not everyone is in for story I guess. Some just want Dragons all over the place and battles here and there.
Craftlords,Truly great acting there!
Craftlords,"Ned isn't a total dick. He had to kill that guy, because that's just how it works. He ran away from the wall that is a crime. Everywhere he would be killed, but Ned took his life himself. I don't have the time now to say my thoughts, but I really don't agree with this..
"
Craftlords,Maybe to fuck with the readers? Sounds perfect for George ;p
Craftlords,"That is funny, but that fight last episode wasn't even that bad. I mean now they are talking shit about eveyr move these girls make. "
Craftlords,"Most of those feminist claiming to watch Game of Thrones, didn't even watch the show in the first place. Like serious they came up with the most stupid things xD"
Craftlords,"I don't know the whole story yet, but in the books I have read Stannis is way more a 'person'. I love him in the show, but he is just kind of different in the books to me. And he is nicer in the books. In book 3 (maybe it was in the end of 2?) Stannis did go to the wall. Like he did in the show, but in the show it is just so rushed. He comes in the woods, is in Castle Black and now he is on his way to Winterfell. And Renly's death was different in the books. Can't really remember that, but in the show he is sending Melisandre with Davos to him and that was definitely not the case in the books. He still had something to do with it, but just not like that. Hopefully someone can fill me in on that... And also his 'sexual' needs like last episode where he touches her body. That is not the Stannis I know from the books.

And next to that I loved the Davos story after the Blackwater which I don't really remember in the show so probably that got skipped. "
Craftlords,"You didn't get my post right. I have already seen it, but told that it was amazing as hell. You see me seeing ""Thx for sharing this just with me!?"" ;)"
Craftlords,"Stannis is a man of honor, and those wo are traitors die!"
Craftlords,"I missed that, what did he say?"
Craftlords,"I haven't read the book where this event happens yet and I'm a Jorah lover aswell (if that is a right name for it...), but I don't see why people think that Tyrion will be able to help Jorah out. Dany doesn't want Tyrion to be a advicer or her king? I don't think she really likes the Lannister, ritgh? But he is an amazing speecher so maybe  he will be able to get some things and he did kill his father. But Jorah will probably not be killed not by her hands. From the moment he stept in that fightingpit you could just see that Dany know it was him, or atleast though of it, and she looked proud when he slaid those men without blood. "
Craftlords,"Most of the time I am just watching and after the episode I am like: ""Wtf.. What the .. fuck happend here! No way! No he can't be death!"". But last episode I was really celebrating when Cersei got in that jail ;)"
Craftlords,"""I wasn't asking little princess"". How one of those girls said that was serious ridiculous. Even I could do it better, but still a like everything in Game of Thrones. "
Craftlords,I guess it is the trail episode?
Craftlords,Most likely wll be something different.
Craftlords,"Khal Drogo raped here, there is no need for discussion right? It's just a fact. "
Craftlords,I like your sarcasm ;D
Craftlords,"Yes, but she got all the maesters from places everywhere to help her. Don't think Jorah will have that..."
Craftlords,"&gt; Ramsay rapes Sansa in front of Reek. She is upset.

Well if this girl just gets a bit upset after rape I am sure she will be fine ;)"
Craftlords,"When you read the books you know a lot more, and for me when I really like something it is easy to remember things. "
Craftlords,It's been almost a full week. I don't want to here one other word about this topic.
Craftlords,"Bad is serious the wrong word. It isn't as action packed and fast as last seasons, but definitely very good!"
Craftlords,"That is kind of dissapointed, but still it is a great story!"
Craftlords,"This one for sure, thank you!"
Craftlords,Didn't though about it. Would be cool though ;3 Got a mancruch on Jorah xD
Craftlords,Definitely gonna use this one!
Craftlords,I know right. I have read the first 3 books and book 4 is coming soon here ;D
Craftlords,"Probably yes, but we don't know how fast it would go..."
Craftlords,I feel terrible bad for him.
Craftlords,You don't know the difference between like and love?
Craftlords,"I guy who has to much god in his ass. Nah, not my hero."
Craftlords,No time to think of *little* things.
Craftlords,Wel ha-ha-ha! At first I though you linked the wrong picture.
Craftlords,"""Why do you guys still argue that Stannis is the rightful king when he did something like this?"" Get your facts together, before making statements like that about our king. The rightful heir! Stannis!"
Craftlords,That is an amazing name for it ;D
Craftlords,Probably die.
Craftlords,"Yep, pls kill them all. Fake fans.

*Downvotes are coming!*"
Craftlords,"That's why I ask. I know, I see people seeing it over and over again, but I want some opinions about that."
Craftlords,"People ARE upset because she got raped, because most crying woman now aren't even familair to the show but pick this up as one of there feminsm shit things. I am serious done with this. Hopefully E8 will have a way more brutal rape scene and theon don't just looks, but has to help a hand too. Goddamn leave this already. I am done with it."
Craftlords,They are building things up. I think we are getting a season finale with some very shitty things to happen.
Craftlords,"That is what I though, but they where the only north bastards I could think of. So it was more a question like ""Why Jon and Ramsay, how?"""
Craftlords,Please. Just please stop posting about this.
Craftlords,It will be either Joffrey-mode or he will die. That's what I think xD
Craftlords,"Yes, but HBO didn't air Game of Thrones on that day. So you would have one week no Game of Thrones."
Craftlords,"He even lifted his hand so that the guards would stand down. Like serious! He could fuck here all day long, but no let her take away!?"
Craftlords,Maybe it was that xD
Craftlords,We don't even know if that is true too ;D Tyrion could have paid those girls to say that ;P
Craftlords,Still I feel terrible bad for him ;)
Craftlords,"How badly I want Theon to help Sansa, take revange, do something I can't see that happening. It is almost not possible. Look in season 2 when his own sister came to rescue him! He stayed loyal to Ramsay! And beside that it is still Game of Thrones.. I could see him being killed by Ramsay or when Stannis comes..."
Craftlords,What a shame. No role worthy my greatness. Maybe season 7 then.
Craftlords,"I love it! And hopefully Tyrion can do a good word for Jorah, because I love that guy even more!"
Craftlords,I don't think she did that. At least not in the tv show. Not 100% sure.
Craftlords,Lets fund that bad porno.
Craftlords,I am defintly not going to read this novel about that scene.
Craftlords,"I loved it, but I love everything with Jorah and Tyrion xD"
Craftlords,I love this man. I hope he will survive this... Or just go the Lee way xD
Craftlords,There is no Theon left. I think that is made very clear in season 4. Before he will be Theon again a lot more would need to happen and probably Ramsay would need to die.
Craftlords,You should add a spoiler onto that ;D
Craftlords,You know what is worse.. I feel more sorry for Theon at this point. I find him really sad and I hope he will kill that Ramsey. God sake!
Craftlords,Fixed the title: Heroic old lady not to speak under Ramsay's torture?
Craftlords,"Maybe his acting will be great, but he defintly doesn't look like a good joker to me."
Craftlords,But why do people think Dany would be overly happy with Tyrion. It is a Lannister. She isn't gonna give him everything he wants? What do I not see?
Craftlords,I was kind of joking too. The acting was really great and it was really Game of Thronisch. If you understand what I mean.
Craftlords,"Well sory then, but that is not what I did read."
Craftlords,"Okay, that one made me laugh xD You got me good ;D"
Craftlords,"I already said that, but I don't count that as a dead. It's like a walker died in the Walking Dead."
Craftlords,"Don't know why you get downvoted, but you are wrong. The question is ""who would you want to take it?"" and everyone has different opinions. Although I agree with you now ;3"
Craftlords,But the fighting pits are only for volunteers. In the first season I really though they would end up together (Jorah and Dany). But at that time I didn't really know what kind of story this is. Now I know better...
Craftlords,"Varys isn't fucking. You know he doesn't have a doorbel down there, right?"
Craftlords,He doesn't seem weak to me? 
Craftlords,"You know Game of Thrones is based on books. They will follow the mainline from the books and not just do a 50 minute battle with horses, dragons and white walkers everywhere. And if it means that the rest of the season sucks nope. Better a great story then a big battle with everything in it."
Craftlords,"I really like here character and she is exactly a very funny woman, and for sure a good actress. But opinions I guess xD"
Craftlords,Just 4 more episodes... 
Craftlords,Great scene ;D
Craftlords,Littlefinger is up to something... like always ;D
Craftlords,Lol so you have watched the second episode first ;D Well no big problem there was guy that watched the Walking dead final s5 because he though it was episode 1 ... That is a bit worse xD
Craftlords,http://img.pandawhale.com/post-42168-Tyrion-confused-speechless-gif-fCwP.gif
Craftlords,"Bye then.
"
Craftlords,I like 'the new' Daario much more. I don't know he just is great.
Craftlords,I wish I could say this ;P Have fun watching!
Craftlords,"Well Sansa and Geoffrey haven't met yet, so how could we pick one?"
Craftlords,Yeah he did.
Craftlords,"Yeah true, but still liked it ;D"
Craftlords,"""I loved them since the beginning"" every single guy here."
Craftlords,"It does seems the same size to me, but from different angles it just looks different."
Craftlords,"Agreed, but that is not the question ;P"
Craftlords,"It's a very normal question. Tyrion Lannister and Dany aren't going to be friends right away, that is for sure."
Craftlords,Theon died a long time ago...
Craftlords,She was.
Craftlords,"It was exactly quite good, but I liked the fighting scene in episode 6 too."
Craftlords,I don't think that is George RR Martin's way of writing ;D
Craftlords,Viewer? Most woman who did get crazy about it didn't even know what the hell Game of Thrones was. Old ladies did go crazy on facebook about he gross it was and shit. And then they said things about the show that aren't true -.- Kill them all I would say.
Craftlords,Our grammar king. Thx didn't think of that one ;D
Craftlords,"Sorry, but that is just shit to me. Rape is a part of the world George created and has been in the show from season 1. Now it happend to Sansa and all of sudden it is a big deal. Theon got tortured for god knows how long. Even his penis is removed. Didn't hear a lot of people (and especially woman) crying about that. 

I hope we will see some more rape, just for this whinig."
Craftlords,"I sounded a bit harsh, right.. Sorry for that ;D"
Craftlords,"Yeah, I will read every single letter ;D"
Craftlords,"Totally of the topic, but can I ask why you hate the Starks? All of them? "
Craftlords,"Yes, just you."
Craftlords,For Sam's protection and he is going to the wildlings. Bringing a big dangerous wolf with him sound like a great plan?
Craftlords,It was...
Craftlords,So you're fine by watching this if you have seen the first 4 seasons ;)
Craftlords,"I don't know if there will be a trail by combat, is that how it works for these people?"
Craftlords,"I knwo that feeling with other books, movies and tv shows. When people go read or watch it you wanted to tell them everything, but then there is no fun in it for them ;D"
Craftlords,"Jon was at Castle Black and well no Walkers there (yet) and the others are nothing near them. So no Walkers is easy to understand, but most likely we will see some next episodes!"
Craftlords,"He is doing a serious great job, but I have been feeling that with a lot of actors on Game of Thrones lately. That besides I am in a love-hate relation with the high Sparrow ^^ "
Craftlords,"Still had one of the wallpapers from episode 5, but now I need to change once again :D Keep 'em coming!"
Craftlords,"Memorial Day weekend or somehting like that last episode, so that's why a lot less people."
Craftlords,"So when her story doesn't effect the people in, for example, Kingslanding it is kind of worthless? I can't agree with that. "
Craftlords,"I think you are right, didn't think of it like that!"
Craftlords,Better then that actor who is going to play the joker now ^^
Craftlords,"If you only watch the show (and catched up untill season 5) you are fine by looking this. Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) sings about a death in season 1,2,3 and 4. And Jaime talks about his sister and some Ramsey and Reek jokes. They will not spoil anything more. And it is really great had a good laugh ;P"
Craftlords,I think they are building up something big..
Craftlords,"In the end you see him looking, and I though serious he was going to fight Ramsay, but no ;( And at the 'wedding' you see him atleast having some trouble talking about Ned where Sansa is, because he does care. He fucked up, but his story is so sad."
Craftlords,Mod-free week? What is that for bullshit?
Craftlords,You can't just forget the story of the almighty JORAH!
Craftlords,Jon Snow and Ramsey Bolton? 
Craftlords,"The dumbest thing to do is start around book 4. Just start with book one. There are so many stories that aren't told in the show and you will get to know a lot more. Skip the first 3 books and, in my eyes, you could better skip all the books. "
Craftlords,"Yes, but it's Jorah!"
Craftlords,Let's do that!
Craftlords,Nice pun.
Craftlords,Pirates are afraid for Valyria and won't go there. 
Craftlords,Episode 7 was yesterday on tv. Do you still have to make a topic about this. Pls stop!
Craftlords,He looked pretty alive to me. And don't start about that guy with the dragon ;)
Craftlords,That makes sense lol ;D
Craftlords,"Theon told him about the candle, then Ramsay 'asked' the people who served her?"
Craftlords,My real question is how many of those feminist claiming to be big fans of the show did really stop watching Game of Thrones? Or where even watching the show before.
Craftlords,I think you are more then right. 
Craftlords,Wow... how could type that.. I am just going to say that it was because I was so busy with my work.
Craftlords,If I hear one more thing about this I swear to you I will do way worse then rape.
Craftlords,"Just take Jorah back, DANY!"
Craftlords,He is the rightful heir. And he has been really growing on me this season. 
Craftlords,I just feel sad for people who are downvoting this. How old are some people here.
Craftlords,"It's funnyt hat it where two woman. Those are mostly the once who are crying for... attention? Drogo raped Daenerys there is no doubt for me in that part. In the show that was pretty clear and even in de books it is too. I can't speak about Cersei rape in the books, because only read the first 3 and can't remember if that happend. She got raped and it was a pretty shit scene. In the good way, I wanted Theon to snap. He just had to jump on that prick, but he didn't. And you heard Sansa what sounded pretty fucked up.

Those woman should be called back to the show and a real fan would need to tell them what really happend in the books. I hope they don't make future decisions based on all this crying people. Just keep the rape as brutal, or even worse. This is Game of Thrones. Nobody makes you watch it, but it is a show about murder and rape is a big part of the world George created."
Craftlords,I came.
Craftlords,"Is she in Westeros yet? Where was Varys planning to go? Where is Jorah now with Tyrion? I'm sorry, but your point sounds really stupid. Even if her story didn't effect anything: she is in MEEREEN! Not in Kingslanding and when a story doesn't effect everyone in Westeros it isn't for nothing. Like serious.. facepalm moments here."
Craftlords,"I know that I watch Game of Thrones, but I wasn't scary he would die."
Craftlords,"That sounds so cool ;D I feel terrible sad for Theon since the beginning and have always been hoping he will get out of it all. It won't be easy for him, but I have hope! Don't know his story in the books since I haven't read that far yet ;S"
Craftlords,"It was when Jaimy said: ""It's a threat."" And then Cersei 'screams: ""Of course it's a threath! I will burn there city's to the ground if they touch her!"". "
Craftlords,Winter is really coming yes.
Craftlords,Let's hope it was just a bad start ^^^And indeed want to see some more of Doran. I haven't catched up with the books to this point yet and I have no idea of this guy can walk xD
Craftlords,"I'm sure it will still be Game of Thrones, but correct me if am wrong. ;3"
Craftlords,"I had this one on the list, loved it! Thx ;P"
Craftlords,You don't deserve those downvotes ;D 
Craftlords,Tyrion on a dragon burning Cersei... Yeah I would give a lot of money for that.... ;)
Craftlords,Is she really going down that way? I like her more when she was with Khal. 
Craftlords,What would the spoil? Like you can't spoil anything in Game of Thrones.
Craftlords,"He know he was fucking both of them, Sansa and Theon. Theon told Ramsey that he didn't kill the Stark boys. "
Craftlords,But a murder or a thief is usually not rich and have no gold for a good fighter. 
Craftlords,"Looks nice, but no :)"
Craftlords,Hundred and one stories from Hodor.
Craftlords,Tommen will activate Joffrey-mode.
Craftlords,"This doesn't spoil any story. So yes, no spoilers."
Craftlords,Amen to that xD
Craftlords,You did your research. Are you up to something...
Craftlords,"Dany and her dragons are nothing similar then for example Sansa and Lady (her direwolf). And where did you hear someone say that they are her genetically children? I don't think people actually think those three dragons came out of her. And even if you stay with the point ""Those eggs weren't hear, she isn't there mother"" look around you. Do you know someone who did adopt a child?"
Craftlords,So Illan Payne isn't a hypocrites that likes chopping heads of in there spare time? 
Craftlords,"Predicatble.. nah, I don't agree with that. And who did die this episode?"
Craftlords,"Well he did look a bit weird, but I honestly don't want to believe it. It would be one hell of a twist.."
Craftlords,"Khalisee is a good way to call her, because she is. The call Cersei the Queen too so that point isn't right ;)"
Craftlords,"I have no doubt there are chapters that you could skip and time is a bit of an issue, but I just want to read the whole story. I like all the extra stuff, and how he can fill pages and pages for just one thing. Everyone has his own thing ;D"
Craftlords,Robb wanted the North. Not the Iron throne.
Craftlords,Exactly though the same ;D
Craftlords,"In the show he didn't was a very big part for the first few season, but this season he has been really great. Although I haven't read all the books yet I think he should be the king. He is the rightfull heir and he deserves it."
Craftlords,Theon died a long time ago... Well that is funny we had the exact same comment ;D
Craftlords,"He isn't the most important character, or the funniest, but I love this man and he is my favorite! Jorah is love!"
Craftlords,Is it me or do some people go crazy when watching Game of Thrones? ;3
Craftlords,"Didn't really though about it like that, but some people here are like Dany and Tyrion are going to be the best mates. Maybe he will get to fly on a dragon, but that would be because he is small..."
Craftlords,This made me giggle ;D
Craftlords,"We can see that, ;D"
Craftlords,"And hopefully Tommen will die soon. Not just for Cersei, but he is just a kid that can't be a king."
Craftlords,Thx didn't know about that post. Although I am reading the books this is wonderfull! How much lore and history in these books is so great!
Craftlords,"And there goes her last fuck. Sorry, I mean food."
Craftlords,"Have to agree with that, but I see it as a good thing. Because it doesn't get lame or boring so if they can make the series a bit longer this way and still be at great quality I don't care."
Craftlords,Literlly a dirty girl ;)
Craftlords,It would be kind of funny xD Not 100% sure if I would use it...
Craftlords,People hate Brienne? I though she was quite funny with Pod.
Craftlords,This is awesome ;D So funny and just look how great actor Alfie is. Just his face!
Craftlords,I want his character to break for so long!
Craftlords,What am I missing. Who do you think?
Craftlords,"I watch in good quality and never had this problem. Some scenes are meant to be dark, but pitch black never. I can see everything fine and could count the amount of stones in a wall."
Craftlords,Thenk you.
Craftlords,Not a big fan of LOTR only seen the first 2 movies a long time ago. So I just say that everyone is asoiaf would win ;3
Craftlords,Why did you use same picture for little Sam for season 1 and 5. Little Sam wasn't even born in season 1/2.
Craftlords,If you think this has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention.
Craftlords,"Because now there is a woman involved. And nowadays you have those weird race called 'feminism'. This race thinks that woman are everything, gods that need to be loved by everyone. And anything that shows them weak needs to go. "
Craftlords,I have never heard it before and tried to hide my laugh at work. ;)
Craftlords,Did they just showed us a dead Selmy?
Craftlords,"I though the same when she said it, then she mentioned the marrige.."
Craftlords,"George decides while writing to split the story, because the story was getting to much for 1 book. In his eyes it wasn't smart to just cut it, but split the storys. So AFFC has (if I am correct) has the story mostly focused on Kingslanding and then ADWD focused on the other storylines.

So why people would read it like this? I don't know it is a lot more work while you basicly can enjoy the book. Just go read first AFFC and then go on with the books ;P"
Craftlords,Have already seen it. Amazing as hell ;P
Craftlords,"I knew the moment that it was Theon when I saw all that dogs in the cages. And I am so so terrible sorry for that poor guy. I wish he would have said something like ""Sansa... they aren't dead"". "
Craftlords,"I am convinced that there is something going to happen, but if they are going to kill Dany off what about the dragons? And I would love to see her atleast trying to go to Kingslanding/westeros. Maybe it is going nasty with Stannis and Ramsay. We still have Theon and Sansa there."
Craftlords,They both are for sure ;D I just like Alfie a bit more.
Craftlords,"Yep, they did ;P"
Craftlords,"It always can be better, but I know what you mean. Although I really enjoy all the things that had happened this season. Exactly quit a lot in my eyes."
Craftlords,"Thenk, you Stannis. de! Grammyst. Verry Thank. yoU"
Craftlords,Bit disappointed in myself that I forgot this one. Thx I'll use this one for sure ;D
Craftlords,Because it is Jamie Lannister I guess?
Craftlords,"I haven't catched up with the books yet and for sure am not a spoiler reader, but I know who LSH is... like it is so manny times mentioned everywhere does some people still don't know who LSH should be? ;D Just curious.."
Craftlords,They just need to do an extra '15 minute' episode where that happens xD
Craftlords,"""Ramsay your father will have a boy, a real Bolton"" Well that would help Sansa a lot?"
DoubleHunter,Don't look at me. Who knows where these fan terms come from.
DoubleHunter,"[A happy ending, eh?] (http://www.bustle.com/articles/86100-game-of-thrones-ramsay-bolton-vs-joffrey-7-reasons-the-north-needs-to-begin-praying-for/image/406295)

I'm not denying that the Slaver's Bay arc will have an impact on Dany's character. I just think that the place will become irrelevant after Dany leaves it for good."
DoubleHunter,"I guess it was something about a ""training arc"" not being interesting TV."
DoubleHunter,You mean Captain Hook?
DoubleHunter,Don't trust IMDB.
DoubleHunter,"How about that Yara action? Pretty sweet, right?"
DoubleHunter,"It can still happen. I remember the Purple Wedding episode's synopsis being something like: ""Joffrey and Margaery have breakfast."""
DoubleHunter,"If it's actually going to take place next season I wonder why they're hyping it so much. But then again, they did the same thing with the Purple Wedding."
DoubleHunter,Maybe he meant Robin.
DoubleHunter,"Soon to be dead: Stannis, Shireen and Selyse."
DoubleHunter,My two biggest complaints are that ultimately the fate of Slaver's Bay is irrelevant and that there are pretty much no interesting Essosi characters.
DoubleHunter,"With Ygritte and Mance dead, he's pretty much the only Wildling that the viewers like. Unless of course we meet some decent new Wildlings at Hardhome."
DoubleHunter,"If those are mad decisions, then I guess 95% of the characters in GoT are mad."
DoubleHunter,"The love story in itself was very generic, but that wasn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem was that she ate up so much screentime. I'm not against the idea of D&amp;D making Robb the main character of the Northern rebellion subplot, but at least they should have made it more interesting. But no, instead of developping Robb's relationships with his mother, uncles and bannermen they decided to develop his ultimately irrelevant relationship with Talisa."
DoubleHunter,[Stormcrows you say?] (http://postimg.org/image/573vxqjl1/) [Daario you say?] (http://postimg.org/image/v92niqubv/) [Egg you say?] (http://postimg.org/image/nv3o1txph/) [Hmm...] (http://i.imgur.com/o9WUsU7.png)
DoubleHunter,They recently released a behind the scenes video where we see Iwan in a camp set with blood on his face.
DoubleHunter,"That would indeed be interesting. Would the child actually be a bastard, since Ramsay is kind of an unlegitimized bastard? I guess Stannis could legitimize Ramsay before executing him."
DoubleHunter,Both.
DoubleHunter,"It's a good season, but not as good as Season 1.

Blackwater is my favorite episode of the whole show, Theon is my second favorite character and his arc was done perfectly and Tyrion as Hand was great. However, Season 2 still had stuff like Robb and Talisa and Dany's Qarth arc. And there are only two episodes in Season 2 that I truly love."
DoubleHunter,To draw parallels between characters I guess.
DoubleHunter,"I'm not sure that the lords of the Vale would attack Stannis. They supported Robert during his rebellion, and apparently like the Starks and hate the Lannisters. Stannis is Robert's brother and has just restored House Stark, brought down House Bolton and is fighting against the Lannisters. Also as a bonus, he has a letter that proves that Ned supported him, and Yohn Royce seemingly was Ned's buddy. Why would they fight against him? Hell, Sansa's probably pissed at Littlefinger for giving her to Ramsay, and she could reveal the truth about Lysa's death to the lords of the Vale."
DoubleHunter,"And he started the series as a bastard. Also, Littlefinger used Lysa's family name to become the acting lord of the Vale."
DoubleHunter,"Agreed. I actually like Dany's character, but the Essosi characters that she meets (aside from Khal Drogo and the Spice King) are just so boring."
DoubleHunter,"The showrunners keep saying that they aim to finish the show in 7 seasons, but they've also mentioned 8 as a possibility. HBO wants it to go on for 10 or more seasons, but also say that they will ultimately let the writers decide.

I'd be down for 8 seasons or at least an extended 7th season to wrap the show up."
DoubleHunter,No hypeless man may watch the season finale!
DoubleHunter,I'd be down for a disfigured Loras. The only question is: how would he be disfigured?
DoubleHunter,"I've learned to love Ben. However, I'm starting to dislike Matt more and more."
DoubleHunter,"If you ask me, the only real drop in quality the show's had was Season 2. After that it has just been going up.

This season is pretty similar to Season 3. 

- King's Landing is not the most important location
 
- We have a new fan favorite who most people didn't like in previous seasons
 
- One storyline is somewhat build around Sansa's wedding

- Tyrion is not the central character of the season

- Jon Snow has to work with a new faction of people

- One or two storylines will (presumably) have epic and shocking conclusions

The biggest reason why people started to love Season 3 quicker than Season 5 was probably ""Dracarys""."
DoubleHunter,If it's not him then I'll be shocked. The real mystery is the actor. Brian Cox? Mark Strong? Ian McShane? There are so many good choices.
DoubleHunter,Unsullied = people who only watch the show.
DoubleHunter,"Some people just hate zealots, I guess."
DoubleHunter,"Out of the 18 000 that marched south with Robb only about 4 000 men survived (primarily Boltons). Some houses in the North like the Manderlys, the Mountain clans and the Dustins still have most of their strength left, while others like the Mormonts only have something like a few hundred men left."
DoubleHunter,I think it was Episode 4 in the scene where Mace left for Braavos.
DoubleHunter,"But then again, Drogon actually burned a child."
DoubleHunter,"Bronn nailed it perfectly a few episodes back: ""The Dornish are crazy. All they wanna do is fight and fook, fook and fight."""
DoubleHunter,What did AudioSly spoil?
DoubleHunter,"I dunno. I think it should be used in the episode where winter actually begins, which is probably going to be S5E10."
DoubleHunter,I never said that she wasn't the Lady of Casterly Rock in the books.
DoubleHunter,I actually thought that she was genuine in that scene.
DoubleHunter,"I recently talked about this on an other thread, so I'll keep this short. She's lost at playing the character. Margaery's genuine moments seem forced and she's transparent as hell in her moments of manipulation."
DoubleHunter,"Mirri (in the show at least) could have just said: ""when pigs fly""."
DoubleHunter,Viserys. He really was our first big character death.
DoubleHunter,"Lol.

Tommen better start setting up traps."
DoubleHunter,Ian McShane is my top pick for Randyll Tarly :) .
DoubleHunter,"They actually got Marshall to direct Blackwater at the last minute because the original director had pulled out on a short notice. It's a miracle that he managed to pull it off, and man did he pull it off well."
DoubleHunter,"Sure, but IMO ""The Winds of Winter"" is a lot more ominous and actually fits multiple storylines instead of just one. The connection with Episode 9's title is also nice.

I'm also not 100% certain that ""For the Watch"" is in the finale."
DoubleHunter,Or why didn't he send some soldiers outside to look for her?
DoubleHunter,In the finale? Hasn't it been all but confirmed that the pit scene will happen in Episode 9?
DoubleHunter,Is Dany's infertility even a thing in the show?
DoubleHunter,"I think GRRM himself has said that there's a lot of Tiberius in Stannis. Particularly Tiberius as he was portrayed in I, Claudius."
DoubleHunter,Perhaps.
DoubleHunter,Non-lethal poison.
DoubleHunter,Inspect her if you must.
DoubleHunter,He left his Riverlords to protect their homes. Robb only had ~3 500 Northmen left at the Twins who weren't Karstarks or Boltons.
DoubleHunter,To me at least flaws are what make characters interesting.

DoubleHunter,"Man, almost everything points to something horrible happening to the Baratheons this season. If Stannis and Shireen both die, fuuuck."
DoubleHunter,You'd be surprised.
DoubleHunter,It's been confirmed that Bran's not in this season.
DoubleHunter,You might be more right than you know. I think it's very likely that all the major female characters will survive.
DoubleHunter,Ramsay.
DoubleHunter,"The show is very inconsistent with troop numbers. In a  conversation Littlefinger had with Tywin he said that the Starks and the Lannisters had larger armies than the Tyrells. But Renly still had 100 000 men and Stannis' army at the Blackwater had to be around the size of 20 000 men because he came to King's Landing with 200 ships. So more than 80 000 of Renly's men were from the Reach, which is a much larger force than either the Lannisters or the Starks can muster."
DoubleHunter,Cool. I'm just genuinely surprised because I constantly see people calling Theon one of the best written character in the series.
DoubleHunter,In Stannis Baratheon's Whacky Northern Adventure Episode 6: The Tarth Strikes Back! Rated PG-13.
DoubleHunter,"Charles Dance&gt;Sean Bean&gt;Alfie Allen&gt;Peter Dinklage

So far the best of Season 5:

Stephen Dillane&gt;Lena Heady&gt;Kit Harrington&gt;Peter Dinklage"
DoubleHunter,"Yeah, like Jorah stealing the boat. I couldn't almost see anything in that scene."
DoubleHunter,Just wanted to know if you thought that Stannis losing to the Boltons was a likely option. Stannis and the Boltons all dying is also a possibility though.
DoubleHunter,"Man, are Pycelle and Qyburn really that forgettable?"
DoubleHunter,"Yeah, claiming that GoT's showrunners are sexist towards women is like claiming that the Wire's showrunners are racist towards Whites."
DoubleHunter,"Tyrion has the most. Survived the Eyrie, survived the Green Fork, survived the Blackwater, survived the trial at KL, survived the Stone Men attack, survived the slavers..."
DoubleHunter,Psst. There are spoilers in the link.
DoubleHunter,"Not really. I'm more disappointed in the soldiers from the Reach and the Stormlands looking super similar to each other. Oh, and Jaime wearing Oberyn's clothes and the Darth Sansa outfit have to take the cake."
DoubleHunter,"Comedy.

Jaime and Bronn's reactions to the Sand Snakes had me rolling on the floor."
DoubleHunter,He was taken prisoner by the Freys.
DoubleHunter,It's a pretty big step to go from petting kittens to ordering murder.
DoubleHunter,No worries.
DoubleHunter,This has been going on since Season 1. It's the money Lebowski.
DoubleHunter,"From what we've heard, the journey will be different but the destination the same."
DoubleHunter,Only problem is that Littlefinger isn't smart either.
DoubleHunter,The Dornish subplot could certainly use a flamethrower guitar.
DoubleHunter,"Lesson here, 'Bri: You come at the king, you best not miss."
DoubleHunter,That's literally the worse thing that could happen. Oh wait... What if Ramsay kidnaps Shireen?
DoubleHunter,"Yeah, they did.

I agree with you on the second half of S3 being the point where Breaking Bad turned to gold. The first half on the other hand... let's just say that it contains my least favorite part of the entire show AKA the cousins."
DoubleHunter,I know. I was making a lame joke about the voice he used in the video being his actual voice these days.
DoubleHunter,Over the High Sparrow and the Tyrells? Hell yeah.
DoubleHunter,"It was so bad that it was actually good.

- ""Oh, for fuck's sake."" was easily the best line of the episode
- The awkward way Obara was trying to mimic Oberyn's fighting style was hilarious
- Jaime's face when Obara started ranting was hilarious
- The move that Hotah pulled was actually pretty cool"
DoubleHunter,"It certainly makes her more relatable, but it still doesn't bring the child back. If the deed is gruesome does the motive still matter?"
DoubleHunter,"I think tens shouldn't be given away too easily, and the Wedding Daze was one of the most atmospheric scenes that they've ever done. They should definitely bring Jeremy Podeswa back for future seasons."
DoubleHunter,"Yup. 

The biggest reason is that books 4 and 5 move at a snail's pace. Plus, they had already used certain material from them in Season 4 like Theon taking Moat Cailin and the Lords of the Vale questioning Littlefinger."
DoubleHunter,"This is character development. 

Sansa has always been a survivor not a player. This is pretty much the first time since Season 1 that Sansa has to rely on herself and make her own allies. When she was in King's Landing characters like the Hound, Tyrion and Shae came to her aid. Now the only person inside Winterfell that was helping her is dead, and she has to (presumably) take advantage of Theon's guilt to make him help her.
"
DoubleHunter,"He probably has some important stuff to do in the plot, but you gave me an idea."
DoubleHunter,Keep in mind that Cersei believes that Sansa played a part in Joffrey's murder.
DoubleHunter,Can't go anywhere without the Witcher 3 being hyped it seems. Hurry up mail service!
DoubleHunter,Tony wouldn't die of one bullet anyway.
DoubleHunter,Ramsay with blood on his face. Please give me a Stannis vs Ramsay duel.
DoubleHunter,Jaime in the Riverlands is gold. The Greyjoys are entertaining. One Brienne chapter has one of the best monologues of the entire series.
DoubleHunter,Indeed.
DoubleHunter,"While we're at it, let's feed Grey Worm and Daario to the dragons and make Adebisi Dany's advisor."
DoubleHunter,"Everyone? Hardly. Sansa not escaping is a lot more important than the lives of a couple of soldiers. Plus, they would return if the mission was a success."
DoubleHunter,"For a second there I thought you were going to behead the winner.

- In Episode 209 Joffrey shows his new sword to Sansa. What was the sword's name?
- Who said: ""King Stannis is my God""?
- Who did Tommen's second actor play on the show before playing Tommen?"
DoubleHunter,"I know why she wants to kill her in the books, but why would she kill her in the show when Sansa is so close and Brienne is clearly trying to protect her?"
DoubleHunter,Jaime and Tormund .
DoubleHunter,"Stannis vs Ramsay. Maimerbowl, get hype!"
DoubleHunter,"I want to see him use the ""touch of death""."
DoubleHunter,"I doubt that LS would knows about her killing them, and even if she did it's highly doubtful that she'd believe that the Hound was protecting Arya. So the only decent ""evidence"" of her betrayal would be the sword."
DoubleHunter,Yes! Give them bitches the Denethor treatment!
DoubleHunter,Varys' contact could have given him the poison say that it was lethal.
DoubleHunter,"I'll rank them according to the first 6 episodes:

1&gt;5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2"
DoubleHunter,"It was meant as a rhetorical question, but nonetheless I like your answer."
DoubleHunter,"IMO neither of them earn even of half the things that they've gotten.

I listed the things that Ramsay has done to get where he is now down below if you're interested."
DoubleHunter,"The books.

Roose Bolton had about 10 000 men of the Northern army under his control after the Green Fork. After he started to secretly work with Tywin he started sending the Stark loyalists in his army on suicide missions. Once he came to the Twins he had with him about 3 500 Boltons and 500 Karstarks."
DoubleHunter,And some people are actually saying that Bryan Cogman's a bad writer.
DoubleHunter,That's certainly the post-Dance Targ law. I'm not sure what type of succession law is used after Robert takes the throne in the books.
DoubleHunter,They have no idea what's going on outside Winterfell though. Brienne could have a few dozen men-at-arms with her that could climb over the walls at night and rescue Sansa.
DoubleHunter,It would also be harder to promote the new season without one of their three leads.
DoubleHunter,For what?
DoubleHunter,No. After the Arryns the Tyrells are my least favorite Great House.
DoubleHunter,In the books Renly declared himself king before Stannis.
DoubleHunter,I'd still expect more from Olenna's protÃ©gÃ©.
DoubleHunter,"Yeah, I'll edit it into ""some people"". A poor choice of words on my part."
DoubleHunter,Other than two of the three biggest characters in the show meeting for the first time?
DoubleHunter,"The Greyjoy theme, the Stark theme, the Stannis theme and the Rains of Castamere are all great. If Dany's theme counts as the Targaryen theme then that's my favorite."
DoubleHunter,"That's cool, but me and a lot of other fans didn't."
DoubleHunter,Jaime.
DoubleHunter,Because the regular sparrows don't have the dope.
DoubleHunter,"Jorah can make it noticeable. And even if the opponent thinks that he could win, there's a big likelyhood that he can still catch the disease during the fight."
DoubleHunter,"[The Lion King] (http://41.media.tumblr.com/b33eabc54866ea77752babf85207b7e3/tumblr_n6irukxnJP1suijfxo2_1280.jpg)

"
DoubleHunter,He was probably just drinking blood.
DoubleHunter,It would be extremely painful.
DoubleHunter,I dunno. Roose would probably put Sansa through some pretty horrible training if this happened.
DoubleHunter,"This again?

What do you want? Sansa having some BS plot about seducing a blonde hunk while she's constantly being manipulated Littlefinger? I'd take Sansa in Winterfell any day over that snoozefest."
DoubleHunter,[The Smallest Council.] (http://i.imgur.com/37ZqQBh.jpg)
DoubleHunter,"Game of Thrones has a bunch of great directors, but Neil Marshall puts them all to shame."
DoubleHunter,"It's funny that in the books neither Ramsay or Stannis are exceptional warriors. However, in the show both Stannis and Ramsay are probably in the top 5 considering episode 209 and episode 406."
DoubleHunter,"Spread the word, darlin'. Stannis back."
DoubleHunter,Yup.
DoubleHunter,"Hmm. Perhaps the High Sparrow would believe him, and declare him king because all the other canditates are either infidels or abominations. Not sure if Gendry would want to be supported by radical fanatics though."
DoubleHunter,Tell that to Balon Greyjoy.
DoubleHunter,"He wrote to Barristan about Jorah being a former spy, which led to Dany banishing Jorah."
DoubleHunter,Savvy?
DoubleHunter,For the lols?
DoubleHunter,They're certainly no ravens.
DoubleHunter,Rocking the best moustache on the show since Joffrey's wedding.
DoubleHunter,By Tommen. Stannis certainly will not see that as a valid legitimization.
DoubleHunter,"Syrio: What do we say to the god of death?

Obara: I am Obara Sand, daughter of Oberyn Martell!"
DoubleHunter,"1. Could you elaborate?

2. The only ones who came back for another season after their deaths that come to my mind are Charles Dance, Jason Momoa and (if he counts) HafÃ¾Ã³r JÃºlÃ­us BjÃ¶rnsson. Dance and Momoa had just one scene to film. That's hardly comparable to Kit having to (presumably) film dozens of scenes."
DoubleHunter,"People usually really hate the awful things in GoT that are relevant in the real world. This is why an average GoT viewer dislikes stuff like zealots and rape, but in turn loves stuff like duels to the death."
DoubleHunter,They already send Jorah a royal pardon back in Season 1. I assume that the letter they send to Barristan (which was given to him by one of Varys' little birds) was a copy of that pardon.
DoubleHunter,You and me both.
DoubleHunter,"Anything's better than ""Hear Me Roar""."
DoubleHunter,Cool.
DoubleHunter,Because the leeches were BS in the first place. She just saw Joff and Robb's deaths in the fires and tricked Stannis into believing that the leeches did it.
DoubleHunter,Thanks. I'll edit it.
DoubleHunter,She didn't fly so good.
DoubleHunter,I don't think they do. It's just a nickname.
DoubleHunter,"What else in Episode 10 would blow the fans' minds? The Walk of Shame? Nah. Kevan and Pycelle's assassination? Probably not. Arya and/or Dany sailing back to Westeros? Not really. LS? I think that ship has sailed. The only thing other than ""For the Watch"" that would blow the fans' minds would be something crazy happening in Winterfell like Stannis being killed."
DoubleHunter,"I think she's wearing [this] (http://images.spoilertv.com/cache/game-of-thrones/Season%205/Promotional%20Episode%20Photos/Episode%205.04%20-%20The%20Sons%20Of%20The%20Harpy/7_FULL.jpg) dress, but it just looks black because of the lighting."
DoubleHunter,"He was probably dreaming or being delirious, and thought that he was a young boy again."
DoubleHunter,That's interesting. Personally I think this season is a vast improvement over the last three.
DoubleHunter,"God no. Episodes 4, 5 and 6 were better than episodes 1, 2 and 3. Kissed by Fire and What is Dead May Never Die were both the second best episodes of their respective seasons. ""Sons of the Harpy"" wasn't a bad episode, and it still has what is so far the best scene of this season. As for ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unroken"". I think people are letting the Sand Snake fight (of which I would mainly blame the director) and the last scene (which I thought was very well written) cloud their judgement.

Are people forgetting the stuff that D&amp;D have pulled over the years like Talisa?"
DoubleHunter,You don't want to piss off the church. Even in medieval Europe the greatest of kings bowed to the Pope.
DoubleHunter,"I'd go with James Purefoy. The Following was just cancelled, so he needs work."
DoubleHunter,I think that there's a teeny-tiny chance for Nymeria (the furry one) to appear.
DoubleHunter,No one cared who I was until I put up a spoiler.
DoubleHunter,So Syrio beat Sansa? Huh.
DoubleHunter,He learned the move pretty recently.
DoubleHunter,"If Roose wins:

1. Take the North. 2. Marry Sansa and declare her the Queen of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale. 3. Kill the Lannisters.

If Stannis wins:

1. Swear fealty to Stannis. ?. Maybe ask to be married to Sansa. 2. Attack the Lannisters. 3. Get rid of Stannis (and Shireen). 4. Declare Sansa as the Queen of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale."
DoubleHunter,"Stannis vs Ramsay will possibly happen in Episode 9, and then Stannis vs Roose could happen in Episode 10."
DoubleHunter,Aaah. Now I get what you're saying. No worries.
DoubleHunter,"Jon will probably be stabbed in Episode 10 then.

I still don't see how they plan to deal with Kit Harrington doing Season 6 not leaking."
DoubleHunter,"So is Jon actually going to be stabbed in Episode 9?

What decision? How to execute Theon? What to do with Brienne?"
DoubleHunter,Or for Stannis himself... please god no.
DoubleHunter,"Damn, I forgot about that one. Time for an edit. Well done sir/miss."
DoubleHunter,Well that's your opinion. Personally I prefer the first 6 episodes of Season 5 to the first 6 episodes of seasons 2-4.
DoubleHunter,[Huh?] (https://youtu.be/kEUFBtxzPww?t=25s)
DoubleHunter,That would be sweet.
DoubleHunter,Theon and Sam are odd picks.
DoubleHunter,"Also, the idea that Sansa is becoming a master plotter is just BS. She's a freaking amateur, and lying about Lysa's fate doesn't change that. Sansa's strength has always been her endurance.

It would be like people complaining about Ned's fate. ""Ned for once tried to plot and in return he was thrown into a cell. HBO is not allowing Ned to be developed into a strong manipulator. The writers clearly don't know how to write male characters."" Why are people who were fine with Ned's fate complaining about Sansa's rape? "" Sansa so far is not raped in the books and the rape of an innocent girl is THE worst crime a person can commit."""
DoubleHunter,"A character doesn't need to be a flawless saint for people to like him. Also, most Stannis fans on Reddit base their opinions on the books where the scenes that you listed are either very different or don't even happen."
DoubleHunter,"Littlefinger never asked if he was a liar, so the joke's on him."
DoubleHunter,"The evidence of Littlefinger looking after her is even more so. Catelyn believes that Littlefinger betrayed Ned. How is Littlefinger exactly protecting her by giving her to the Boltons, and why isn't he there? How does Catelyn even know that Littlefinger is ""protecting"" her?"
DoubleHunter,It was a reference to Littlefinger's line in Episode 3.
DoubleHunter,"And Littlefinger did most of his work with Lannister and Arryn/Tully ""papers"".

Both Ramsay and Littlefinger started near the bottom, and have gotten very by using other people and their family names wheter it's Stark, Lannister, Greyjoy, Arryn or Baratheon."
DoubleHunter,"This is pure speculation, but if Doran is in Team Dany he might hold Jaime in captivity for her. Aside from Stannis, Jaime is the biggest ""Usurper's Dog"" left."
DoubleHunter,"[Indeed, poetry.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7SnkMcX_gw)"
DoubleHunter,"Nope, unless you count Catelyn's kids."
DoubleHunter,It'll depend on Sansa. Sansa could divulge that Littlefinger killed Lysa and Joffrey and that he forged the Tyrell-Lannister alliance.
DoubleHunter,I really hope that both Alfie and Iwan will appear in this year's Comic Con panel.
DoubleHunter,"Perhaps, but Natalie's Margaery is on a freaking new level of transparency."
DoubleHunter,"What's funny is that I live even further north than Montreal, and I'm not sure if I've ever been in a snow storm that's that bad."
DoubleHunter,Nimble Dick?
DoubleHunter,Looks like a Frey minion. Walder Frey did say that he'd find a new wife. Maybe he has set his eyes on the auburn prize.
DoubleHunter,"They're mostly just following the books, so maybe your criticism should directed at GRRM?"
DoubleHunter,A Shadow Pinocchio?
DoubleHunter,There's been very little of Pycelle in this season. Perhaps it would be smarter to keep him around?
DoubleHunter,"[Yeah, about that.] (https://youtu.be/dgsDdJy2-0g?t=3m24s)"
DoubleHunter,The wine was probably not lethal. It did get Drogo moving after all.
DoubleHunter,"&gt;Her entire arc just feels completely pointless, or at least directionless.

Couldn't you say that about every character?"
DoubleHunter, [I think we both know.](http://starseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Aidan-Gillen-in-The-Dark-Knight-Rises.jpg)
DoubleHunter,"Some reasons why the drop in ratings might be happening this season:

- The first 4 episodes leaking online

- Mother's day

- Memorial day

- The abysmal marketing

- People getting too used to the show having a huge event every other episode from last year

- The continuing increase in online piracy

- Some people quitting the show after Episode 6

- People not liking Tyrion not being the biggest character of the show

- People failing to see the quality in the Wall storyline because they automatically assume that it sucks

- People failing to find Cersei entertaining"
DoubleHunter,Remember when in the Inside Episode 409 video David Benioff was all smug about not using slow-mo most of the time because he thought it was cheesy? The man is clearly an expert on what is and isn't cheesy.
DoubleHunter,"Jeez, so that's going to be Sora's new voice."
DoubleHunter,"Dorne is the second least interesting region in the Seven Kingdoms, while the Riverlands are the most interesting."
DoubleHunter,"- The Walk of Shame

- Possibly Kevan and Pycelle's assassination

- Possibly Dany sailing back to Westeros

- Possibly the conclusion and aftermath of the Battle of Winterfell

- Possibly Arya sailing back to Westeros

- Possibly Jon's stabbing

- Possibly something that heavily foreshadows Jon's resurrection

- Possibly Balon's death"
DoubleHunter,"IIRC he actually dismissed that in another interview.

Also, work is work, and GoT would definitely make him more famous again."
DoubleHunter,"Theon is weak. Not just mentally but also physically. He's chances of killing Ramsay unarmed are pretty low, and if he'd fail... I don't even want to think about what Ramsay would do to him. Even if he'd kill Ramsay, he'd still need to escape from inside the keep or stay and be flayed by Roose."
DoubleHunter,"Yes!

The Faceless Men are also annoying emo weirdos."
DoubleHunter,"It's probably just a guess. Personally I would prefer ""The Winds of Winter"" as the title."
DoubleHunter,"Tbf it hasn't been doing that since Season 2, and that's fine. The changes made on the show shouldn't really have an effect on the books. No adaptation of a novel in history has been 100% faithful to the source material, and demanding a TV adaptation of a book series as massive as ASOIAF (which hasn't even been finished) to be super faithful to the source material is kinda ridiculous in my opinion."
DoubleHunter,And the hand... Jesus was that fucked up.
DoubleHunter,Somebody play the Jeopardy music.
DoubleHunter,How long have you been a fan of the series? Theon has A LOT of fans.
DoubleHunter,"God, I wish they'd go back to the old Small Council chamber. I can see the point in Cersei holding meetings in the Tower of the Hand, because she's a Tywin wannabe and all that, but man..."
DoubleHunter,The Vale.
DoubleHunter,"I dislike Arya's Braavos arc, the Faceless Men and Book Jaqen, and even I can't deny that Tom Wlaschiha is awesome in the role and makes the character so much better than he is in the books."
DoubleHunter,How could he reveal it? And would he even want to rule?
DoubleHunter,"To me most of Natalie Dormer's lines sound forced, so I don't really care if it fits the context or not. I just pick the line that is the most forced."
DoubleHunter,No. The line was already crossed in the pilot. Sansa's rape isn't even in the top 30 list of disturbing scenes in GoT tbh.
DoubleHunter,"She's finally out of her Darth Sansa attire, thank god!"
DoubleHunter,"""No godless man..."""
DoubleHunter,"And I was here thinking that they weren't doing the Ironborn storyline.

Seriously though, Benjen might actually replace Howland Reed in the show."
DoubleHunter,"Not really, Roose could have easily just send Ramsay to the Wall and fathered a new son.

If we go by the books:

Ramsay had to attack the Hornwood lands, starve Lady Hornwood, infiltrate Winterfell, gain Theon's trust, defeat Ser Rodrik's larger army, burn Winterfell, torture Theon for the period of months and flay a bunch of Ironborn to get where he now.

If we go by the show:

Ramsay had to torture Theon for the period of months, fight a group of Ironborn and flay a bunch of Ironborn to get where he is now."
DoubleHunter,"While the Cersei chapters and the Greyjoy chapters are entertaining, I have to agree with you here. Jaime's chapters are the only ones that are actually consistently well written and live up to the quality of the previous books."
DoubleHunter,"Three cures: axe, sword and cleaver."
DoubleHunter,"Oh, for fuck's sake.
"
DoubleHunter,I don't even...
DoubleHunter,I forgot how creepy Skyler looked in that episode.
DoubleHunter,It's certainly more interesting than her Qarth arc or her relatively easy conquest of Slaver's Bay. Emilia Clarke's performance is also better than in previous seasons.
DoubleHunter,Blackwater.
DoubleHunter,"The Wall: A+

Winterfell: A

King's Landing: A-

Tyrion's roadtrip: B+

Braavos: B

Meereen: B-

Dorne: C-"
DoubleHunter,"This year's Episode 9 will probably be similar to ""The Rains of Castamere"", and the finale in turn might be similar to ""The Children""."
DoubleHunter,Episode 10 will be packed as it is. Will there be enough time for a clash between Stannis and the Boltons?
DoubleHunter,"Yeah, but I don't get why it's ""bad""."
DoubleHunter,Also the inn fight. D&amp;D are surprisingly good at directing.
DoubleHunter,Too bad that there's no Cenk.
DoubleHunter,Precisely.
DoubleHunter,Areo was actually pretty cool. The move he showed Jaime was easily the best choreographed move in the episode.
DoubleHunter,"I heard rumors that the guy who was on his stomach is ""a godless man"" or something like that."
DoubleHunter,For you.
DoubleHunter,At this point I might even bet money on him appearing this season.
DoubleHunter,Did she?
DoubleHunter,"No, and it doesn't need to."
DoubleHunter,"The actors grow more expensive every year, and the kid actors literally grow. The core crew probably also wants to move on in their lifes, and can you blame them? They've been making the show since 2007 or something."
DoubleHunter,"Man, I wish we'd had a scene between Oberyn and Olenna."
DoubleHunter,Roose did say that most of them have fled. I guess some small bands of reavers could be found here and there.
DoubleHunter,"Or the somewhat literal ""oh shit"" scene. Then again, we kinda had that last year, and I doubt that they're going to recreate that particular Tywin scene."
DoubleHunter,He'd still be somewhat responsible if someone died.
DoubleHunter,"- It might be the first time in the books where we see Jaime be fully in charge of the situation.

- The people Jaime needs to deal with and the ways he deals with them are interesting. These people include Lancel, the Mountain's men, the Freys, Edmure and the Blackfish.

- Jaime swore a vow to never fight against the Starks or Tullys to Catelyn, and he actually keeps it. This leads to Jaime having to use diplomacy, and he's actually surprisingly good at it.

- We meet Jaime's aunt Genna, who is like the Lannister version of Olenna. She also gives us new insight into Tywin's character.

- Some readers might have seen the Lannisters and their bannermen as the ""villains"" for the first three books, but Jaime's arc in the Riverlands really shows that most of the Westermen are really just decent folk.

- Jaime has been a great fighter for most of his life and has never cared about court intrigue, so it's great to see him find new things that he can excel at now that his hand is gone."
DoubleHunter,Why it's not doing the books justice or why it doesn't need to do the books justice?
DoubleHunter,[S2][S3] is what I see.
DoubleHunter,Hmm. Maybe. There would still be a sizeable cap in Kit's schedule if they'd do this.
DoubleHunter,"Or when Drogo raped Dany. Or when Sansa was almost raped by the mob. Or when Theon was almost raped by Ramsay's minions.

The main reason seems to be that people are more invested in Sansa than the previous rape victims."
DoubleHunter,Stannis.
DoubleHunter,The flaying of the Ironborn increased his ruthless image and ensured that there were no people to spread the word of Theon's capture.
DoubleHunter,"This is great, and so was the Jaime one.

Someone should make one about the Faith Militant."
DoubleHunter,Could somebody actually go back and watch that scene in the Season 1 finale? I remember them talking about Drogo coming back but not about Dany being infertile.
DoubleHunter,Isn't Moon Tea kind of a drug? I thought that drugs were bad?
DoubleHunter,"If Stannis makes an alliance with Littlefinger something will eventually break it, for sure. Might be a good reason to bring back the Hound. He's pretty much the only person that knows about Littlefinger's betrayal of Ned who Stannis and Sansa might trust."
DoubleHunter,Power. Simple as that.
DoubleHunter,"I'd go with ""Look, the pie!"". So forced."
DoubleHunter,A homemade beverage if there ever was one.
DoubleHunter,"I thought this thread was ""[ALL SPOILERS]""."
DoubleHunter,Are the Boltons more important?
DoubleHunter,Olenna's pizza probably has the double figs.
DoubleHunter,GRRM is literally the only person I've ever heard pronouncing them like that.
DoubleHunter,How is she weak exactly?
DoubleHunter,"Shae's testimony implicated Sansa as a culprit.

The Crown won't send an army to Winterfell, but arresting Littlefinger is another matter.

I do agree with the last part."
DoubleHunter,So that's your... flysaber?
DoubleHunter,Nice.
DoubleHunter,Maybe she'll just receive a certain punishment. A tongue for lying or something like that.
DoubleHunter,Did you also see Trystane's sword? Bronn was right about the Dornish being crazy.
DoubleHunter,For powah!
DoubleHunter,Pretty much.
DoubleHunter,"That's apparently their plan. Of course, they could still pull an FMA on us."
DoubleHunter,"Yeah, but the Unsullied are only now starting to really like him."
DoubleHunter,The Tullys are more interesting than the Starks.
DoubleHunter,Examples?
DoubleHunter,That would be all fine and good if her every other line didn't feel forced.
DoubleHunter,There's this guy called Ramsay in Winterfell. I'm not sure he'd be happy to learn that his pet was spreading tales.
DoubleHunter,Probably the Stannis and Shireen scene.
DoubleHunter,"I think that ""King's blood"" is just another name for the ""blood of the dragon""."
DoubleHunter,I think that's fan made.
DoubleHunter,"The biggest obstacle is still Theon's fear of Ramsay.

Ramsay would also probably hear him picking up a chair. A candle to the hair though... I hadn't considered him using fire."
DoubleHunter,"&gt; I got a thing for Theon's sister Yara Greyjoy

Who doesn't?"
DoubleHunter,"Usually when I try to keep something in my mind I forget it, and when I try to forget something it stays in my mind."
DoubleHunter,"Fuck. The kidnapping of little children has happened before on HBO in shows like Oz and Rome, and it's usually the most disturbing stuff for me to watch, so I really hope that D&amp;D aren't going to try and ""top"" their fellow HBO showrunners if they're doing a kidnapping plot."
DoubleHunter,Is that a problem?
DoubleHunter,"Tyrion: You killed your first man before you were twelve.

Bronn: It was a woman."
DoubleHunter,They also mentioned that Jorah fought for the Golden Company before meeting Dany.
DoubleHunter,"IIRC his episodes were pretty well lit, but his action scenes weren't that great."
DoubleHunter,"Some army will eventually march south from the North and Walder Frey has to return at some point. I assume that once those things start happening the Riverlands will become important again, and we'll meet the Tullys and the Brotherhood again."
DoubleHunter,Mhysa.
DoubleHunter,"It's this or ""Kill the Boy""."
DoubleHunter,"Certainly. I mean, it was probably self defense anyway."
DoubleHunter,"And that'll ""break the internet""?"
DoubleHunter,"I love Olenna, but Margaery and Loras are boring and often times annoying."
DoubleHunter,"It's a shame, because Jaime's aFfC Riverlands arc was gold."
DoubleHunter,If the Boltons actually kidnap Shireen I want Stannis to [go full on Tony Soprano on them] (https://youtu.be/qeJdVwyTFfc?t=6s).
DoubleHunter,I hear that you can gain the technique by touching a certain type of doll.
JiveTurkey1983,"That's what LF is hoping.  When Stannis marches south, he'll form alliances with the other northern houses that were fucked over by the Boltons, who would gladly have Roose's head on a spike.

SawRub,"The story of how Roose ended up with Fat Walda always makes me chuckle.

Walder Frey offered Roose the bride's weight in silver as dowry if he married one of his daughters/granddaughters, so Roose Bolton, ever the pragmatist, chose the fattest one."

SawRub,"He's pretty awesome, and I'd like to see him again, but the royalty potential is incredibly low, since if Stannis legitimized him, Gendry would come before him, so he wouldn't do that. He would be a competitor for Tommen, a new Daemon Blackfyre, so Cersei wouldn't let Tommen do that either.

I liked the idea of the son of a King living a normal non-royal life and not going through the fantasy trope of finding out who he is and eventually becoming King."

SawRub,How about [now](http://i.imgur.com/xX3BEhp.png)
SawRub,"Yes, I support Stannis, but I totally get where Loras is coming from. Not to mention, as Renly's chief backers, had Stannis won, the Tyrells would go back to being relatively political outcasts they had become because of siding against Robert in his Rebellion. And also not to mention, Stannis hasn't been fond of the Tyrells ever since they made him, his men, and their families nearly starve to death, so even if Loras and Margaery did go to him willingly, he probably wouldn't give them the good deals that the Lannisters did. They really had no reason to side with him."
SawRub,One of my favorite all time gifs just because it's so unexpected and random.

SawRub,Should have taken the black like his father wanted. Ned Stark would have let him.
SawRub,"Yup.

When a new book hasn't been out in a while, people discuss them more and more and when they run out of things to discuss, come up with theories ranging from stupid to great, and all of them very detailed and meticulously written. This was more of a parody of those, a completely absurd theory, but with the same level of meticulous detail as the actual theories. It was so ridiculous, and people appreciated the level of work and commitment to it, that we upvoted it to the top and it spread from there as the ultimate joke theory of the community.

Some people might believe it of course, but definitely nothing close to R+L."
SawRub,"Yup, most Stannis fans know he's gonna die at some point, and want to keep supporting him until it happens."
SawRub,"That actually sounds like a line of dialogue that an adviser of Daenerys would say to her. Just add a ""your Grace"" or ""my Queen"" at the end or start of it, it works!"
SawRub,Catelyn Stark plays Nathan's mum.

SawRub,"Haha yeah me too. And King Aegon IV was such a dick, that despite this famous rivalry, he sired bastards on *both* those houses lol."
SawRub,"True, if you were paying him, he'd be an unstoppable beast who would decimate anyone in your path. Only downside is that it could turn an entire Kingdom against your family."
SawRub,"They were in the middle of a battle! With less numbers. Olly saw a woman that he had previously seen murder innocent people without prejudice about to murder a man of the Watch. What's he supposed to do, call for a peace meeting? How was he supposed to know that the very same woman also happened to have a romantic history with Jon?

Jon is mature. He understands that Olly didn't do anything wrong. "
SawRub,"Just in case people genuinely wanted to know, it's Red Wedding. We see Tywin writing letters all season and we find out later he was in correspondence with Walder Frey and Roose Bolton."
SawRub,Haha that was a good scene. That sold even last of the doubters of Better Call Saul.
SawRub,I felt like a dad.
SawRub,"That was so cheesy.

And these sisters she's so close with, and this mother figure, they've never heard this story before? This is literally the first time she got an opportunity to tell them this story?"
SawRub,"Yeah don't get stabbed by your own bannerman at your uncle's wedding over it.

Wait that doesn't work as well."
SawRub,"They were still his family. He was about ten when he was taken away from them, he still remembers them well. Of course he would choose his family. Ned Stark treated him well, but he would have killed Theon if Balon so much as lifted a finger.

I can't believe that guy got downvoted into negatives for suggesting that supporting his family, as much as it pained him, was a valid choice. We all love the Starks, but choosing one's family, even if they aren't all nice, isn't an invalid choice.

And Theon was taken because Balon declared independence from the Iron Throne, the same thing Robb did later."
SawRub,Poor girl will freeze.
SawRub,"Apart from the two mentioned, Pod killed one of them during Blackwater and they probably didn't replace him. I think the Hound was (unofficially?) named to the Kingsguard after Ser Barristan was fired, and I guess maybe they forgot to replace him too.

That still leaves one though. Maybe he was standing outside on watch duty so that they wouldn't all be taken unawares and killed if someone threw a grenade inside the room."
SawRub,Jaime stop giving regards please. Last time you did we lost a few Starks.
SawRub,Gave me gooseprickles too.

SawRub,He didn't.
SawRub,What Westboro actually hates also applies here too.
SawRub,I'll allow it.
SawRub,Epilogue/prologue?
SawRub,"Yeah it reminds me of his fight scene in season 1, where the whole season the Dothraki warriors are doubtful of his armor since they claim it slows him down, and at the end of the season he uses his armor effectively to defeat one of Drogo's bloodriders. A true Westerosi knight that one.

Edit:

[Link to the Dothraki fight scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRYM6B7CTs8)"
SawRub,"I think they are setting up for Shireen to be burnt. Maybe Stannis finds out and attacks Melisandre and she kills him. Or worst comes to worst, he lets her do the burning. He'd never do it though, and if he did, it would be so off character."
SawRub,"I think part of it is probably because of the fact that the showrunners absolutely mangled his character in previous seasons. He's better in the books.

And it's made more clearly that he's not under her spell and she's not controlling him. Even if she wants to do small things, he makes her give proof first. He's also funnier in the books.

As for what he's done?

In Robert's Rebellion, he held Storm's End against the entire might of the Tyrell army for a year nearly starving to death. Had he not done that, the very large Tyrell army would have been able to go north and help the Targaryens and could have turned the tide. Immediately after the war as everyone else were celebrating, Robert sent Stannis to instead capture Dragonstone, which he also did.

The Ironborn are known for one thing primarily, their naval prowess. Victarion Greyjoy commanded the Iron Fleet during the Greyjoy Rebellion, and Stannis took the Royal Fleet, caught him in a trap and smashed the Iron Fleet off Fair Isle, after which he captured the largest of the Iron Islands. With the threat of the Iron Fleet gone, Robert and his army were able to safely invade and subsequently subdue the rest of the Iron Islands.

Robert Baratheon never praised Stannis for any of this, in fact, after he captured Dragonstone, Robert actually got mad at Stannis for letting Daenerys and Viserys escape. Yet Stannis always did his duty.

In the current war, he had the smallest army, and his traitor younger brother was about to destroy it in the morning. So he used the one advantage he had, and killed one man. So instead of thousands of Baratheon soldiers dying in the morning, one man died at night, and his soldiers instead joined his army.

Despite losing most of his men at Blackwater, he didn't bow down or negotiate a surrender, but planned his next move.

When Davos told him that the Night's Watch required his help, he listened to sound advice. ""I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.""

He took all 4000 of his remaining knights and left his strategic stronghold near King's Landing and went to save the Wall from a wildlings who had already murdered entire villages. Because of his army's enforced discipline, he was able to vanquish Mance Rayder's army which was *20 times* larger than his.

Even Littlefinger and Tyrion Lannister have called him the finest military commander in Westeros.

And you say he's done nothing?"
SawRub,I always took it like the PHP we use is PHP Hypertext Processor and the PHP in *that* stands for Personal Home Page.
SawRub,"&gt;Loras having a relationship with Renly

No one's complaining about that, he said Loras having a relationship AFTER Renly, which some readers say goes against his character since he's still mourning Renly in the books."
SawRub,"Also apart from the scar, Tyrion is described as being quite ugly in the books."
SawRub,I don't think that's the one. The one being talked about was a private reading.
SawRub,#One True Dad
SawRub,"Yeah I loved the first two seasons.

I tried watching the third a few years back, but I couldn't finish it. I only managed as far as I did because of Effy."
SawRub,He's also wearing Renly's flair and not Stannis'!
SawRub,"While he's a suitably grim entertaining POV, the whole backstory with his wife is too messed up for me."
SawRub,Like the opposite of Batman.
SawRub,"A death was what he had earned, not... this."
SawRub,You can actually see the 'fook' part in his expression!
SawRub,"As much of an asshole his dad is, he's a very badass asshole. This season everyone on the show's saying that Stannis is the finest commander in Westeros, and one of the only people who comes close is Randyll Tarly."
SawRub,Hizdahr doesn't sound like Tyrion in this episode.
SawRub,I think he noticed it too late and now he can't. Like the zombie virus thing on TWD.
SawRub,"The actor, before the season, said he almost had to walk out because of how horrible a scene he had to do was."
SawRub,A full apology is required.
SawRub,It's like the end of World War 2. Japan kept pressing on and then lost because America had nukes. What the fuck? **Who has nukes?**
SawRub,Honestly I liked him more for it.
SawRub,"Also, what's this got to do with Sansa? There was literally nothing in my comment that indicated it was a guys vs girls thing.

You somehow you made a post that poked fun at the most popular character, Daenerys, into mocking fans of the underdog character, Stannis, and when I tried to say that I've seen how the hate started the other way around, somehow Sansa and other female characters got dragged into it? Why are you trying to make this about gender? Reddit's usual misogyny exists of course, but it is a different topic altogether!"
SawRub,"&gt; emperor of Nilfgaard

I'd like to be the emperor of Milfgaard."
SawRub,"They did though, both the Blackfish and Robb Stark both chided him hard about it.

In fact, what they should have emphasized was that Robb didn't tell him the plan. Edmure was Lord of the Riverlands and was protecting his Riverlands because Robb didn't tell him about the trap. He saw an opportunity to fight off Tywin, and he took it."
SawRub,"""Have I reached King's Landing?""

""You're on the wrong fucking continent."""
SawRub,"&gt;Arya is obviously skilled at letting go

She's the tomboyish and wilder younger sister of a more traditional prim and proper older sister who escaped the city, went somewhere else and made a castle in the snow.

I'm sure she knows how to: let it go."
SawRub,"I know people are going to call him unprofessional and stuff, but I love it. You can see in every interview how much research and preparation he had done, and just how much he loved his character, even if he didn't have as much screen time as a the more popular characters. Salty, but with good cause."
SawRub,"I think they are trying to set it up so that the one King still in Westeros who could bring order, Stannis, will die just when people realize that the realm needs him, at least for now."
SawRub,I think he just didn't hear Stannis this time.
SawRub,"I remember back when people were genuinely predicting stuff, it was the upvotes that gave it away."
SawRub,"I can imagine him waking up and going, ""What the fuck, I was just napping. You were about to bury me? You dicks!"""
SawRub,Imagine if Olly walked in this Mel/Jon scene.
SawRub,Ridiculous?
SawRub,She nearly killed Joffrey when he showed her her father and her Septa's heads. Only the Hound stopped her then.
SawRub,"The books are spaces so far apart that after a while, people run out of legitimate things to discuss, and start coming up with more and more outlandish theories. /r/asoiaf celebrates those theories, especially if they happen to contain even 10-20% of somewhat plausible evidence.

Most people do understand that it's completely ridiculous, but it's fun to participate nevertheless."
SawRub,Well he was up against Tywin and Roose Bolton.
SawRub,"My absolute favorite was the one I thought they were gonna show in season 3.

[ASOS/Spoilers all just to be safe](/b ""Nymeria drags a corpse out of the water, being interrupted by a group of loud men, which we later find out is the Brotherhood Without Banners, and they see the body Nymeria dragged out, and that's what led to Catelyn Stark being resurrected."")"
SawRub,"True, True Blood enjoyed how ridiculous it was."
SawRub,I guess it was a colloquialism and Stannis being a learned dude is one of the few people who say it properly.
SawRub,"And once Stannis died, and say there were people who wanted Shireen to be Queen, Renly could have arranged a match for her with one of the Tyrell boys eventually.

He could have had the Iron Throne on a silver platter."
SawRub,"Yeah, guerrilla warfare."
SawRub,It's certainly how D&amp;D see readers who question their interpretation of Stannis.
SawRub,"To the hosts he's probably seen as just the help. First Jaime will have his talk, and then Bronn will be released."
SawRub,Yeah his brother was going to destroy his small army the next morning.
SawRub,"Maybe Sansa *won't* tell Littlefinger, to signify to the viewers that she's isn't under his control entirely."
SawRub,HAR!
SawRub,"I think he will make a big show of wanting revenge for his daughter, and the audience is going to love him for it, and in the end she just points at him and he drops dead and she carries on like nothing happened."
SawRub,Well she *is* the toughest fighter.
SawRub,Anyone got a backup? Link is dead.
SawRub,"&gt; Stannis wouldn't

And he fuckin' hates his wife, and he still wouldn't."
SawRub,"Yeah people even actually said that Tyrion would replace Barristan as adviser, before the season even began. And the trailer came out and basically confirmed it."
SawRub,"Yeah Jaime wanted it to look like a clean fight because if he killed Ned, it would be much cleaner if it didn't seem like he straight up assassinated him."
SawRub,"In the books, Dany actually got to see a vision of what her son Rhaego and his Khalasar would have been like, and it was exactly as feared. As for the accuracy of the visions, they were pretty accurate, they even predicted the Red Wedding in book 2, but we just didn't realize because Dany, having never met Robb, didn't say his name."
SawRub,"Yeah and apart from the fact that Viserys taught her that Starks and Lannisters were the Usurper's dogs, the last two Lannisters her family dealt with actually were not good to them at all.

Jaime Lannister killed her father, and Tywin Lannister who was once loyal to her father, tricked him into opening the gates of King's Landing, and then sacked the city in Robert's name, and then had his men kill Rhaegar's wife and kids.

Should have probably opened with, ""I'm the man who killed Tywin Lannister."""
SawRub,"Haha I remember even non readers saying, as soon as she empowered the Westeros Baptist Church to go after Loras, that this was totally gonna backfire."
SawRub,"Those two were set pieces for the season, so they practiced months for it. The regular short fight scenes tend to be underwhelming, while on other shows they do even the short scenes really well.

Maybe they are going for realism or something, saying that real fight scenes aren't exciting, they are just brutal. Still though, there's a lot more excitement when watching Arrow or the original Black Canary do melee combat, which often even makes up for bad plot lines."
SawRub,She seems so familiar for some reason even though I'm sure it was an extra.
SawRub,That's actually kind of adorable.
SawRub,"i-understood-that-reference.gif

Wait how do you trigger that image linker bot?"
SawRub,"Haha yeah I remember. When Missandei was first cast, a particular gif of her from that show was posted here all the time."
SawRub,"There is room for *everyone* on King Stannis' hype train, good ser, so long as they bend the knee to the One True King. Granting a title like that would rally Northern lords to our cause.

Even under the dragons, the Starks have always ruled the North as Kings in all but in name."
SawRub,I bet she'll say something real dramatically making sure to over-enunciate each syllable.
SawRub,"I started in season 1, when in episode 10, Joffrey is trying to make her cry by making her stare at her dead father's severed head, asking her to look at it, and she just goes like ""how long do I have to look?"" and Joffrey looks flustered at that."
SawRub,They'd have the smartest and wildest kids ever.
SawRub,"Reminds me of the last line of his drop the mic speech to [TWOW](/b ""Theon. ""Tell me, turncloak, what battles has the Bastard of Bolton ever won that I should fear him?"""")"
SawRub,"Shit, in a peaceful world if Tywin, Stannis, Randyll Tarly, Robb Stark and Roose Bolton worked together on military strategy, they could take over the world. Throw in a little Victarion Greyjoy too, especially in case Stannis does doesn't want to take command of the ships himself."
SawRub,"There's only one person I'd remove from your Small Council.

Only Cat."
SawRub,"Exactly, she's clearly close to her sisters and her step-mother, but she said that monologue as if she was revealing her backstory to them for the first time. Who talks like that?

When my mom asks me and my siblings if we want ice cream, and the others all immediately say yes, I don't go into long backstory of how I tasted Ben &amp; Jerry's when I was a kid and ever since then I have been really big on ice cream, unless it was for comic effect."
SawRub,Epic Rap Battles
SawRub,Two continuous Targaryen rulers with very intelligent Lannister Hands.
SawRub,"Same here, but I guess Ramsay probably even doesn't realize what he did was wrong. It's how he himself was conceived."
SawRub,"Theon agreed to fast. If he had really made a change, it would have been dramatic and sudden and triumphant. Instead he said yes, slowly made his way to the top."
SawRub,"And seeing as the show has become so mainstream, this time they'll be able to get even bigger actors, who will even commit. Not just because the show is so popular, but also TV itself is becoming popular for movie stars as proven by True Detective. And if Robert's Rebellion is a miniseries too, it's not as long a commitment.

They could even do a series of Dunk and Egg episodes, with about 2 episodes per novella."
SawRub,Episode 9. Every alternate one we lose the guy we expect to bring justice to the bad guys.
SawRub,"""Stannis is the finest military commander in Westeros""

Littlefinger dropping some respect up in here."
SawRub,Yeah I'm never visiting Valyria again.
SawRub,"I remember that scene where Simon was under the influence of someone's power, and he told her that he wanted to ""piss on your tits"".

I'd like to imagine even Ramsay going like, ""Ew that's gross, man."""
SawRub,"Yeah book Loras is like a younger Jaime from a more normal family, and a relatively normal childhood."
SawRub,I always love the way he says 'bloody tough'.
SawRub,You will.
SawRub,Are we dancer?
SawRub,"It feels like I'm being violated, but I also like it a bit."
SawRub,He's Born Again. He's very guilty. In the first episode of the season I think they covered it.
SawRub,#**ONE TRUE DAD**
SawRub,Did they use the King's Landing High Sparrow set for Meereen too?
SawRub,I can see Cersei saying this about Margaery in that bitchface expression we know and love/hate.
SawRub,He even looks like Aaron Eckhart.
SawRub,It's still his hey day! He has long hey days!
SawRub,Only here a few other places. The rest of the fandom still doesn't like him much.
SawRub,"But you're generalizing all people together. You're clubbing all Stannis fans into the anti-Dany group. I like them both. In fact, I only started supporting Stannis because there used to be so much hate against him. Same way Sansa became one of my favorites. A few years back, forget the rest of the internet, even right here on reddit, people wanted both Stannis and Sansa to die.

It's just recently that the anti-Dany fans have gotten more aggressive, because of the show, and since they need someone else to support, they decided to support Stannis since he was the only available alternative. But that doesn't mean supporting Stannis means one automatically hates Dany.

There are legitimate reasons to like and dislike both Daenerys and Stannis, but the militant anti-Dany and anti-Stannis people are making it seem like it's two very different sides that always hate each other. Most people don't actually hate her. There are always bad eggs that ruin it for everyone."
SawRub,"I'd say if this was the book, then about episode 6 or 7 they'd be captured by slavers just like the show, and they'd go in the general direction of Meereen for the rest of the season, and in the trailer for season 6 we'd see a bit of a scene from like episode 2, and they are still outside Meereen."
SawRub,How could Cersei possibly inherit the Iron Throne? She can't even use the Baratheon name!
SawRub,And he saw Daenerys looking disgusted by the death so I think he made a conscious decision to impress her in the way he knew how.
SawRub,"Great cosplay!

And I think you could also do a young Yara/Asha Greyjoy well!"
SawRub,They're made of Valyrian Steel.
SawRub,"Serves her right. You murder an entire village, you get what's coming to you."
SawRub,"&gt; Stannis's own bannermen flocked to his younger brother

That's flat out wrong.

Stannis was Lord of Dragonstone, and he had *all* his bannermen.

Renly was Lord of Storm's End, and the Stormlands were sworn to him. Yet it was some of *his* bannermen went to Stannis instead. And after he died, even more did.

Robert gave Renly Storm's End, so Renly had about 15 years to make friends with everyone in the Stormlands."
SawRub,You can be reddit's bizarro Unidan.
SawRub,"While that would be ideal, I think this is going to be a tragedy instead. They've established that his troops are suffering. If it was the last resort at the end of the season and he said no, that would be one thing, but he said no too early, which means she's gonna ask again when times are more dire."
SawRub,He has already happened!
SawRub,"GRRM definitely has a lot of fun with that character, especially after ASOS onwards. He writes him very beautifully."
SawRub,"The last time the Mountain went up against Ser Loras, someone intervened on Loras' behalf. Hype?"
SawRub,\*Stannis nods*
SawRub,"I still can't get it to work, never mind, thanks for the help though!"
SawRub,"Don't look at wikis, find a reader you trust to tell you the relevant bits. Seriously, don't open wikis without having someone check it out for you. Hell, even if you type a character's name into google the autocomplete will work against you.

Readers love talking about the series and helping people out with the details, they won't mind."
SawRub,"Well at least he didn't marry an old woman, lock her up in her own castle's tower and starve her until she started eating her own fingers."
SawRub,I'd have liked her to do an internship with Stannis.
SawRub,"Ramsay is kind of the Joker of Westeros.

Let's put a smile on that face."
SawRub,Kinky
SawRub,"I was one of those who watched the episodes, and I kept an eye out for spoilers, but I saw surprisingly few. Three main reasons: 1) The mods have been on top of it 2) A good amount of people are not dicks 3) And people found that other subreddit to discuss leaked stuff instead."
SawRub,"Both Tyrion and Littlefinger said it this season, after Tywin had already died."
SawRub,Doesn't appear to work.
SawRub,Spending all that Lannister money.
SawRub,"A tart, even."
SawRub,"It's been said since the book came out, so I suppose someone over at /r/asoiaf probably gets the credit years ago."
SawRub,They try to breathe fire and spontaneously self-combust.
SawRub,Nothing
SawRub,And she doesn't even know that Reek didn't kill her brothers. I wonder if he'll tell her.
SawRub,"Yeah no incest there, just infidelity. Tywin was married to his cousin too."
SawRub,Can't blame you really. Without the title's context it could be read either way.
SawRub,"Sansa ones were the best, especially when Darth Sansa starts."
SawRub,"Yeah. Because of Ned. Ned told her that when the King returned from the hunt, he would tell him the truth about Joffrey's real dad. He told her that because he wanted to give her a chance to take her kids to safety because he didn't want to see Robert spilling the blood of children. He was trying to show mercy.

But Cersei used it to save herself. She got Lancel Lannister (the guy who now has short hair and is religious that we saw in the premiere) to increase the amount of wine, possibly mixed with something, that kept him awake, but dulled his senses, so that when he went to hunt the boar, he got hunted by the boar instead."
SawRub,When capitalized like that I imagined WEEP being VEEP but a drama.
SawRub,"I don't know, this season has been way too good with Stannis scenes, D&amp;D might feel it's time to add a made-up creepy one instead."
SawRub,"I remember her posting a vine with a crown saying ""I'm ready"" when Joffrey died.

And then another vine sitting on the sidewalk when she was recast holding up a for hire sign.

I'll post the links if I find them.

Edit: Well that was easy, I just googled 'myrcella vine' and it was the top two results.

Link for the first one: https://vine.co/v/MJp2KxmPei1

Link for the second: https://vine.co/v/M0LJpJpgQ3I"
SawRub,I hope Ser Meryn doesn't mean him harm.
SawRub,"And also this season, Lancel actually mentions it to Cersei sometime during Tywin's wake, and Cersei gets uncomfortable."
SawRub,I can't believe Meryn FUCKING Trant outlived the Hound.
SawRub,"That was the best, and Pycelle staying Grand Maester was an understated good one too."
SawRub,"I fight for Dorne, who do you fight for?

(No seriously though, you haven't set your flair)"
SawRub,"&gt;Not all links are purple my friend.

Sounds like something Varys might say."
SawRub,Just added the link in case anyone wanted to remember it.
SawRub,That's why he's doing this. To repent.
SawRub,"Sure, when you do it it's funny, when I do it I'm ""scaring the children""."
SawRub,I believe the only reason he has a POV chapter was because GRRM got stuck in the Meereeneese Knot and was forced to add a POV character to show what was happening in Meereen once Dany left.
SawRub,He wasn't asking. He was doing that thing where they phrase an answer like a question.
SawRub,"A swell guy who led the largest band of murderers and rapists on the continent.

Also according to the book readers, they say that it was only the first time that he was gently, but after that he was not."
SawRub,"That's my thought too. The thing happens, she does the thing, and then seemingly nothing happens. She looks devastated, then they cut to a different location, where the thing that was intended to happen to one person in the previous scene happens to this person in this scene and the season ends with eyes suddenly opening.

Is that vague enough to avoid spoiler or speculation tags?"
SawRub,"Oh look to the sidebar, there's a button that says Edit Your Flair. Follow it."
SawRub,"The Iron Boat is mine, by right."
SawRub,Did he lose both hands?
SawRub,"I should have known it was Theon, since that's where he lives in the books as well as the show, but for some reason I too thought they were gonna change things and make it so that the Boltons had somehow captured Nymeria.

I know it's stupid, but the main reason for me thinking that way was that I had once had a dream that with Arya being in Braavos, Sansa would find Nymeria and they would bond, and she would be her wolf. I dreamed that the North rallied behind Sansa Stark and while Sansa wouldn't actually fight in the battle, she would be in the camp before the battle riding on her horse, with Nymeria running along her, inspiring the troops that fought for her."
SawRub,Barristan is the best.
SawRub,"Lancel Lannister. He was Robert's squire, was having sex with Cersei after Jaime left, keplt sending push messages to Cersei during Battle of the Blackwater where he got shot with an arrow."
SawRub,This season they are making more like the book Stannis than the creepy weird Stannis they had in previous seasons. Everything since he came to Wall at the end of last season has been on point.
SawRub,They used the same music for all three.
SawRub,"I hate the phrase 'gave me chills' because it's so overused, but that line in the book indeed gave me chills."
SawRub,"Stannis isn't saying he killed Mance to make people fear him, he's saying he didn't show additional mercy so that people feared him and didn't have reason to think he was weak. A comparable situation would be if Ned allowed Gared to rot in a jail cell, still a punishment, but one that could make his subjects think he was weak."
SawRub,"I think they were waiting for the Lord Commander to do it, and he keeps getting distracted."
SawRub,"For anyone who hasn't found it yet, /r/insideJorahshead."
SawRub,"They probably do, we just haven't seen them."
SawRub,"If Stannis abandoned the Lord of Light, he could ally with the High Sparrow and have a small army *inside* Kings Landing for when the time came."
SawRub,"While I'd love to see Victarion being badass on this show, I'd like even more to see Stannis catch him in a trap and smash his Iron Fleet off Fair Isle in the prequel, so count me in!"
SawRub,Save me Barry!
SawRub,How long has Jorah worn those clothes? Did Daenerys give him that scarf or something?
SawRub,Little shit wanted to outlaw beets in the books.
SawRub,Tommen won't be getting any tonight.
SawRub,Unless what is hype may never die.
SawRub,"[ADWD](/b ""Cliffhanger was in AFfC. In ADWD she's definitely alive. GRRM also confirmed the word she said ('sword') to save Pod and her life."")"
SawRub,It was the oy.
SawRub,Wait wasn't that implied? She did it soon after Marge taunted her.
SawRub,Reek don't got this. Maybe Theon will.
SawRub,"She had it as a child, and the childhood version of it is a bit less dangerous than the adult version."
SawRub,It was the books I think that she refers to Tywin and Ned as the Usurper's dogs. I was so mad in that moment because this was the first time someone spoke negatively about Ned.
SawRub,"About that House Targaryen description, they just say mention that it was a rebellion and nothing else, and without context it makes it look like the Targaryens were the wronged party."
SawRub,He actually saved Bran and Robb's life in season 1. Right after Robb told him this wasn't his family.
SawRub,Stannis actually explained it to Davos in season 2. The same less/fewer example too!
SawRub,It's a joke. There are many joke theories. This is one of them.
SawRub,"I wish he wasn't so duty bound though. Like if Dany came over with her dragons, I'd rather he agree to be her Master of Ships than burn in a battle against her, even though I know he wouldn't do that because he is the rightful King and stuff."
SawRub,"That's the thing I'm asking about though, most laptops don't have a num lock these days. I used to do it on my old desktop, just haven't figured out the laptop way."
SawRub,"True. We lose contact with Theon in the books towards the end of Book 2, and we find him again in Book 5, and at first we don't even know whose POV we're reading because he's changed so much, and then slowly over flashbacks we realize what happened to him. On the show, the period between the end of the second season and the current timeline has been a couple of years at least, so it's very likely."
SawRub,"Would be kind of hilarious if Brienne keeps waiting for a candle to light up, and it doesn't, and after a few months Brienne is like, ""Well, I guess Sansa doesn't need me after all, time to go."""
SawRub,Oh god that was painful. At the time I was fully convinced that all those private Stannis/Melisandre scenes they were inventing was part of some convoluted plot of theirs to get people to hate Stannis forever because they hated him back when they were just fans of the books.
SawRub,He's in everything and he's awesome.
SawRub,"I know the image you mean, and that was completely fan made.

Besides, they'd never make a promo image of what would be a big reveal."
SawRub,"Meowth, that's right!"
SawRub,"Retirement.

He's like a pro football quarterback who's done with the big leagues and is older and just wants to relax, so he coaches high school football."
SawRub,Oh no he didn't.
SawRub,"And it's not even that effective because it's only in the show that they show Stannis to be 'under her spell' so to speak. In the books he looks at both Davos and Melisandre equally, and she doesn't really have a say, and everything she does seems quite transparent to everyone."
SawRub,Will go well with the Iron Throne.
SawRub,They couldn't handle how cool she was.
SawRub,"Only in the show. That word is not used in the books. The guy that they burnt actually tried to cut a deal with the Lannisters and give them Shireen as a hostage, and *that's* why he was punished, not for being an 'infidel'."
SawRub,"Well I mean it's only episode 7, I'm expecting the Redemption of Theon in episode 9 or 10."
SawRub,It was time for a redesign anyway. The red lighting wasn't very great.
SawRub,Stannis wouldn't apologize.
SawRub,"I wish they'd just retcon him into being Aeron instead, since he kinda looked like he could be Balon's brother, and it would work."
SawRub,"Finale perhaps? Episode 8 might be too soon. And I think episode 9 will be devoted to Winterfell. Perhaps Brienne kills Stannis.

It just wouldn't be an odd-numbered season's episode 9 without a guy who we think is gonna deliver justice to the bad guys dying unexpectedly."
SawRub,"LIAR! So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"
SawRub,Mayhaps.
SawRub,I'd legit change my name to Westeros if it meant getting a decent role on the show.
SawRub,Like Batman.
SawRub,"Yeah despite everything Viserys did, I pitied him when he went out. It was quite sad really. The actor really nailed the scene.

He was a boy with a baby sister he dragged with him and clothed and fed, while begging for support. At one point he even had to sell his mother's crown. The Targ madness took hold though and he went a bit bad, but compared to crazy Targs he wasn't even that bad."
SawRub,"I thought somehow the Boltons had captured Nymeria, and now Sansa, having lost Lady, would not become best friends with Nymeria :(

Also that if in the future someone sent Arya the Faceless Man to asassinate Sansa, Nymeria being by her side would bring No One back to being Arya."

TheEld,"Since you said [SPOILERS ALL], the answer is Aegon VI Targaryen (likely an impostor)."
TheEld,Only with respect the first season.
TheEld,No problem. Just answering the guy's question.
TheEld,"I think you would really like the books, lol. You belong with us."
TheEld,The very first one was this season with the random red priest in Volantis. The only time in the books that people from Yi Ti are encountered (would be played by Asian actors on-screen) is when Dany is in the Western Market of Vaes Dothrak.
TheEld,The sentence mentioning them in Asha's chapter is literally the only time they are mentioned. They are a clan.
TheEld,Yup.
TheEld,"1. Unknown.

2. Infect them with what?

3. The white walkers.

4. Nobody knows how large the army of the Others is. "
TheEld,Ned is largely responsible for the fact that he's at the Wall. Thorne was a Targaryen loyalist during the war and was defending King's Landing when it was sacked by Tywin. He was given the choice between death and the Wall.
TheEld,"""Does at some point, Daenarys really come back to Westeros?""

Not yet.

""Is winter come or is still coming (one day, maybe)?""

Yes, Winter has arrived in the books.

""Arya choice to join Jaqen has some consequences or is it just a ""cool side story ?""

Arya never meets the guy who was masquerading as Jaqen again after escaping from Harrenhal. That's only in the show.

""Is there a link between all the people who believe in that ""Lord of light"" that cast more shadows than light?""

They're linked in that they belong to the same religion.

""Gendry does he matters, or was it just like a disposable character which I should skip scene with the next time I'll look previous seasons ? I thought his royal blood made him more special than just give us sex scene with that hot redhead sorceress.""

Gendry and Melisandre never meet in the books. Gendry is currently with the Brotherhood without Banners."
TheEld,Their castles have certainly been taken over and given to others. 
TheEld,"Martin doesn't have anything to do with the show anymore. He wrote one episode per season for the first four seasons, but no longer. He certainly has never directed anything in his life. And no, there won't be any standalone battle episodes this season. We are not going to see any kind of resolution to Stannis v. Roose."
TheEld,I can go and take it off right now. Benjen Stark has been listed as reappearing on IMBD in at least Season 3 and Season 4.
TheEld,"They were first mentioned in this in 2010:

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_Roleplaying"
TheEld,Are you sure you've read A Dance with Dragons?
TheEld,That's only in the show 
TheEld,Of course.
TheEld,"He was the guy who led the Iron Fleet to Moat Cailin and who took it at the order of his brother, Balon. "
TheEld,He has no say in how the show's story is told.
TheEld,It is already in his will that nobody is allowed to touch it.
TheEld,"[ADWD](#b """"Aegon"" is a Blackfyre, almost assuredly. Neither of them wanted to see Viserys or Dany sit the throne, that's for sure."")"
TheEld,"The Targaryens followed the gods of Valyria before Aegon's Conquest, but the monarchy adopted the Faith of the Seven under Aegon in order to solidify his rule over Westeros. Ever since, every Targaryen ruler has a least payed lip service to the Faith."
TheEld,Because he heard it from Sam who heard rumors about her from ship captains docking in Braavos. 
TheEld,Pretty much all the lords of the Stormlands have sworn allegiance to Tommen. Those that didn't are in the North with Stannis.
TheEld,"King Aegon IV publicly bestowed the Targaryen sword of kings, Blackfyre, on his bastard Daemon Waters instead of his legitimate son, Daeron Targaryen. Some felt that the sword symbolized the monarchy, as it had been the blade of Aegon the Conqueror, so the gift was the seed from which the Blackfyre Rebellions grew.

Aegon IV legitimised all of his bastards on his deathbed. His noble bastards were called the Great Bastards, the most notable of whom was Daemon, a great warrior and wielder of the Targaryen Blackfyre. He took the name Daemon Blackfyre from the sword.

In 184 AC, Aegon IV was succeeded by Daeron II Targaryen. King Daeron was a cultured, scholarly man and reigned over a sophisticated court, attended by maesters and learned men, which was perceived as effete and overly-refined, not pleasing to many of his more martial courtiers and nobles. His marriage to the Dornish princess Myriah introduced foreign influences and manners to the court, further adding to the displeasure with his reign. In addition to the aggravation of the Dornish influences at court, popular rumours held that King Aegon IV's sister-wife Naerys had shared her affections with their other brother, Prince Aemon Targaryen, leading to the possibility that Daeron II was not the son of Aegon IV.

After more than a decade of building tension, the Blackfyre Rebellion finally broke out in 195 AC engulfing all of Westeros, the seeds of this rebellion were planted early on, but it took years for them to bear fruit. There was no final insult, no great wrong that led Daemon Blackfyre to declare a war against Daeron. If it truly was love for Daenerys as some whisper why did Daemon wait eight years before rebelling. Especially since his wife Rohanne of Tyrosh had already given him seven sons and a daughter, while Daenerys had already had several children by Prince Maron.

In truth the war broke out because the seeds had found fertile ground because of Aegon the Unworthy. Aegon hated the Dornish and many Lords and Houses who spent centuries at war with the Dorne longed for the return of those days. Many great warriors looked on dismay on a realm no longer at war and did not like a peaceful, scholarly king who filled the court with learned men, Septons, Dornish and women. They looked at Daemon and saw a Warrior. Many lords and knights with grievances against the Iron Throne soon sought Daemon out.

Other factors was Daemons growing resentment at having the status of a bastard, and what it meant. Another was that he gained councillors who urged him to it. Daeron sent the Kingsguard to arrest him, but Daemon escaped with the aid of Ser Quentyn Ball, the master-at-arms of the Red Keep."
TheEld,"You realize that anybody can edit IMBD, right? The vast majority of people who watch Game of Thrones don't even know who Benjen Stark is."
TheEld,About 3 years and 1 month.
TheEld,"About 5% of the material in Season 5 so far has been from the books. Season 1 was very close to the books (I'd give it an 85% similarity, maybe. The difference were usually just because of having a low budget). Season 2 took more liberties. Season 3 and 4 both really went off the rails and now in Season 5 the books are completely irrelevant to the show."
TheEld,"Jon Arryn planned to send Robert to Dragonstone, but Cersei found out and convinced King Robert to interfere and send him to Casterly Rock instead."
TheEld,Petyr Baelish and Olenna Redwyne.
TheEld,Game of Thrones is not a book series. And it isn't like nobody ever gets naked in Inheritance. Remember the Blood-Oath Ceremony in Eldest?
TheEld,None of that is in the books. Ramsay marries someone completely different and Sansa never goes to Winterfell so I really can't tell you.
TheEld,"To be fair, Sansa never goes back to Winterfell in the books and [MAJOR SPOILER ADWD](#b ""Jon is no longer the Lord Commander."")"
TheEld,"Ugh, why?"
TheEld,That's the time I'm talking about.
TheEld,Jaime needs to get his ass to Riverrun.
TheEld,Seriously? What was the point of changing that?
TheEld,I'm fine with changes. I'm not fine with throwing out logic and retconning things within the series.
TheEld,And RIP Theon's favorite toy.
TheEld,Very much so. I can't believe we haven't seen Nymeria since the first season.
TheEld,Pretty much all of them.
TheEld,"There's no way Jorah should already be able to tell he has contracted the disease. That was just a bit of foolishness in the show in order to rush the revelation. It was also odd that Jorah was so concerned about the stone men touching them. The disease is generally spread through water/urine/feces. So it made no sense for Tyrion to dive into the water. Apparently things are different in the show, however. *shrug*"
TheEld,Yes
TheEld,The Night's King is resurrecting Jon in the show.
TheEld,"It varies greatly depending on where you're talking about precisely, but on average, I'd say around 250 miles from Westeros to Essos."
TheEld,"[](#b "":D"")"
TheEld,The circumstances are very very different in the books.
TheEld,"None of them. The books have just stopped being very relevant because the characters in the show are no longer following the paths that their counterparts in the books do. If you want to know the main characters that have diverged the most, however, it would be Jaime, Brienne, Melisandre, Tyrion, Sam, Barristan, Davos, and Sansa. "
TheEld,What are you talking about? I'm pretty sure characters in Inheritance have boobs as well. 
TheEld,Doreah died in the Red Waste.
TheEld,"Of course. The whole planet experiences the changing of the seasons. And yes, according to Legend when the Long Night happened thousands of years ago, Essos was also invaded by beings different cultures throughout the continent have their own names for."
TheEld,Braavosi?
TheEld,"The title of warden is of a strictly military nature, carrying no connotations of suzerainty. There are no seats connected to the four wardens. Ser Jaime Lannister was the Warden of the East briefly and he sure doesn't hold any lands or castles.

"
TheEld,Kevan? Kevan shouldn't be dead yet in the show.
TheEld,"Slowest season? This is the most rushed season so far, since they're trying to condense almost half of the story of A Song of Ice and Fire so far into ten hours."
TheEld,The Citadel poisoned them.
TheEld,He's Illyrio's son.
TheEld,"You're completely off. Read the end of Jon's story in A Dance with Dragons and then come back, lol."
TheEld,"I meant from sea level, yes."
TheEld,Of course not.
TheEld,How so??
TheEld,"Oh, geez.. Not possible."
TheEld,"Depends on who you ask. According to the Crown Tommen I Baratheon is the lord of Storm's End as well as the King. But according to Stannis he is the rightful lord of Storm's End, and he does still technically possess it at this point. His man, Gilbert Farring, is still holding the castle (though Stannis certainly has no control over all the lords of the region)."
TheEld,No. And that isn't exactly how greyscale is spread. It is a virus that spreads through bodily fluids and is also waterborne.
TheEld,It is spread through bodily fluids and can also survive in water. Generally people are afraid to even let those afflicted with greyscale touch them.
TheEld,They should not have tried to condense AFFC and ADWD into one season. Horrible idea.
TheEld,Name the only still-surviving Sarnori settlement (Saath).
TheEld,Looks like Stannis just died. 
TheEld,In what way? The Wall wasn't built to keep out wildlings that want to sail south.
TheEld,How do four people constitute the majority of the people that live in the Red Keep?
TheEld,Loras and Renly were both complete caricatures in the show. 
TheEld,You also gotta love how everyone just stood there a few feet away from the dragons and nobody else was harmed.
TheEld,Nope. Never by that nmae.
TheEld,Correct. But Ned was one of the people who started the war.
TheEld,"The scene doesn't happen in the books, if you're wondering. Sansa never gets raped by Ramsay. She never even marries him."
TheEld,"Don't think Dany really cares, lol. "
TheEld,"Mother Merciless, you mean."
TheEld,Bruh
TheEld,Why? The guy literally asked for it and tagged the post appropriately. 
TheEld,What? When did you see the guy masquerading as Jaqen in the show ever slit anyone's throat?
TheEld,This fly is a major problem!
TheEld,How about where you left off?
TheEld,"Yes, there is. Everyone in the North knows. Cersei should know."
TheEld,It's pretty ridiculous in the show.
TheEld,Lazy screenwriter #2.
TheEld,She heard about Joffrey's in the show.
TheEld,Why do Muslims follow different hadiths? Why do Christians take different writings as canon?
TheEld,What...? This is not Dorne.
TheEld,Because they are tired. David and Dan have said this in interviews. They are anticipating being done with it and getting to rest on their laurels. 
TheEld,"Does he know that he didn't actually kill Bran and Rickon? Uh, yeah?"
TheEld,"Yeah, he doesn't even talk about it at all any more on his blog. He used to post the promos for the next episode each week but now it's like he would just prefer to pretend it doesn't exist."
TheEld,"He was talking to Jon, though..."
TheEld,The trail? Huh?
TheEld,"That wasn't an army of Wildlings.. And Mance Rayder's army was in the Frostfangs, not north of the First of the First Men."
TheEld,"Lol and you know that Jon is supposed to know that Bran and Rickon are alive because Sam told him in the show, right? You would think that might come up when Stannis offers to make him lord of Winterfell.

Oh, and they won't be. Thoros and Beric were both also on Arya's list last season but aren't this year. We'll never see them again. "
TheEld,Not for the show.
TheEld,"That never happened in the books. Sansa never goes to Winterfell. She's at the Gates of the Moon right now and is pledged to be married to Harold Hardyng, the heir apparent to the Vale after Robert Arryn."
TheEld,Whitehills exist in the books as well.
TheEld,You didn't spoil anything. No idea what they guy above is talking about.
TheEld,"In A Game of Thrones, Dany prays to members of the Seven and also to the Dothraki's horse god. She's a young girl without any nuanced or set faith."
TheEld,Littlefinger's.
TheEld,Not anymore.
TheEld,That isn't going to be in this season.
TheEld,"She isn't even a Tyrell by birth. She was born a Redwyne and simply married into the family. She has absolutely no kind of leadership position whatsoever. And no, House Lannister is the richest house in Westeros. "
TheEld,"It was never actually revealed in the books either yet, as you realize."
TheEld,One of the absolute worst changes yet. Valyria is sacrosanct. Hate that they screwed it up so bad.
TheEld,"Ghost- With Jon Snow at Castle Black

Grey Wind(Robb's direwolf)- killed at the Twins during the Red Wedding

Summer- with Bran at the cave of the three-eyed crow

Shaggydog- with Rickon on [ADWD](#b ""Skagos"")

Nymeria (Arya's direwolf)- in the Riverlands. 

Lady(Sansa's direwolf)- killed by Ned at Darry"
TheEld,Do you even watch the show?
TheEld,Working with Littlefinger? What?
TheEld,"Current small council:



Queen Regent - Cersei Lannister

Hand of the King - Harys Swyft (books)/Nobody (show)

Grand Maester - Pycelle

Master of Laws - Orton Merryweather (books)/Nobody (show)

Master of Coin - Gyles Rosby (books)/Mace Tyrell (show)

Master of Ships - Aurane Waters (books)/Mace Tyrell (show)

Master of Whisperers - Qyburn

Lord Commander of the Kingsguard - Jaime Lannister



"
TheEld,"The books. Obara and Nymeria are supposed to be the only ones of Oberyn's eight daughters who know how to fight. Obara has a spear like in the show but Nymeria should be the one with daggers, not a freaking whip. And neither Tyene, Nymeria, or Obara are supposed to be Ellaria's daughters. "
TheEld,What? After who defeated Stannis?
TheEld,Haha
TheEld,You shouldn't really associate George with anything that goes on in the TV show anymore.
TheEld,Of course. Copper pennies and halfpennies are the smallest units of currency in the Seven Kingdoms. Pennies usually have the seven-pointed star on them. 
TheEld,Of course not. The Battle of Castle Black spans four chapters in A Storm of Swords and lasts for over a month. You just finished the first of those chapters. Alliser Thorne and giants are definitely part of the battle and it is thoroughly more epic and also more realistic in the book. 
TheEld,"He isn't a writer for the show, so no. The writers are free to use whatever they want from his books, of course. And Tyrion's line about sucking a dwarf's cock was in his internal monologue in A Dance with Dragons. He never said it out loud."
TheEld,"The Crown is broke. The Lannisters certainly aren't. And yeah, I guess you're right as far as the show goes. she certainly never does anything like that in the books."
TheEld,Crap. I forgot that in the show Tywin said the mines at Casterly Rock were dry *sigh*
TheEld,Please no
TheEld,If you count all the characters which appeared briefly but then were never heard from or seen again.
TheEld,"The DVDs of each season come with history and lore videos which are available on YouTube. Take not that while very similar, the history and lore presented in them is quite different from that in the books often. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPI_xA1SoRg"
TheEld,"And he only has authority over Tarly soldiers, which include those that serve House Hunt, of course."
TheEld,You really have to stop conflating the books and the show.
TheEld,He has all the motivation in the world right now. What are you talking about?
TheEld,"No idea. The Sparrows are not very violent at all in the books. They don't care about prostitution, homosexuality, or drinking. That's just all nonsense in the show so we can have more violence, action, and nudity. But yes, the High Sparrow is looked up to by his followers, though he would never claim to be giving orders."
TheEld,"The biggest outrage is the fact that the Sparrows are supposed to be a hugely sympathetic group. In A Feast for Crows they formed as a reaction to the horrors of war and only want to protect the faithful, the impoverished, the downtrodden, the oppressed, etc. They aren't bothered by prostitutes, gay people, drinking, people worshipping other gods, etc. They certainly don't carve stars into their foreheads or murder anybody."
TheEld,"So it's rape based simply on the age of one of the participants in your eyes, then.Sexual maturity has been an indicator of adulthood for most of human history."
TheEld,Yup. The writing has tanked since they've started trying to do their own thing instead of adapting the storylines from the books.
TheEld,Yup
TheEld,"Yi Ti, Leng, or the plains of the Jhogos Nhai."
TheEld,No. 
TheEld,When did you ever see any white walkers walking towards the Wall??
TheEld,Because they were following the books in Season 1.
TheEld,Because he didn't know he had greyscale until weeks after he contracted it.
TheEld,The biggest change between the book series and the television show is that the messages being conveyed are completely different. 
TheEld,The world he created is different from the world in the television show.
TheEld,"It looked like you were saying he was from the Reach or something, lol."
TheEld,Bran is in Westeros..
TheEld,Obviously. That's the Horn of Joramun. 
TheEld,No.
TheEld,Which book is the recent season? That makes no sense. Books have chapters. They don't have seasons.
TheEld,We know Cersei's walk is happening this season. There have also been pictures of Tyrion and Daenerys sitting together in Daznak's Pit. Rumor has it that Varys is going to kill Littlefinger as well.
TheEld,"It is still unknown who the castellan at the Dreadfort is, at the moment. Ramsay is the Dreadfort's lord, however. 

It seems like you're confusing Winterfell for Castle Black. But to answer your question, maesters are appointed by the Citadel to serve at castles."
TheEld,"They used the same names as characters from the books, obviously. "
TheEld,Of course not. It's just a normal sword with a glamor on it.
TheEld,"Yeah, I guess so in the show. Doesn't really make sense and it doesn't work like that in the books."
TheEld,We've seen Dorne.
TheEld,"I was specifically talking about the pillaging of septs, since you said that wasn't shown."
TheEld,He wanted to go for a walk. Out in the streets of the city by himself. Pretty sloppy way to kill him.
TheEld,Did you watch Season 1 and Season 2?
TheEld,That was Baelish that talked Robert out of sending a faceless man.
TheEld,"Oh, yes it does. That's ridiculous. All the lords of the North are being invited to the wedding, as it's purpose is to secure their allegiance. If news from Meereen is making its way to Castle Black (which really doesn't make any sense) then news from the North should be making its way to King's Landing and the queen regent, for crying out loud."
TheEld,That's the problem. He does a ton in the books.
TheEld,So you really aren't going to tell us anything? Then we are forced to conclude that you are bullshitting us.
TheEld,Yes.
TheEld,"No, he didn't. He got it from diving into the Rhoyne at Chroyane, and he certainly didn't start to show signs of the disease immediately after coming out of the water."
TheEld,What? No he hasn't. Not even close. There is months of material that hasn't bee covered yet.
TheEld,That was Brienne and Pod. Unbelievable that in the show one can just go around Moat Cailin. *shakes head*
TheEld,"No. A crowned stag was the sigil of the Durrandons, the Storm Kings."
TheEld,That's not her.
TheEld,"He is the Lord Protector of the Vale, which means he is running things since little Lord Arryn is not yet of age. "
TheEld,"Yeah, and the sorrowful man tries to kill Dany with one in the second one, in case you forgot. And Dany just saw manticores in cages when she was in the Eastern Market in Vaes Dothrak."
TheEld,What did Littlefinger have to do with the dwarves at Joffrey's wedding?
TheEld,"Walder is supposed to be over 7 feet tall, but he still shouldn't be as tall as Gregor, who is almost at 8 feet."
TheEld,Good points. You've almost convinced me. 
TheEld,"Robert was only king for about 15 years, not 17."
TheEld,Not really.
TheEld,Don't worry. Literally 0% of what we have seen of Dorne in the show is from the books.
TheEld,"How is that an error? A crowned stag has been the sigil of House Baratheon since Aegon's conquest, and before that it was the sigil of House Durrandon since the Dawn Age, according to legend."
TheEld,"I think you're confused. Books don't have seasons. If you would like to read a series of books, you begin with the first book, however."
TheEld,"It isn't. The only Lannisters there at the start are Cersei, Jaime, Lancel, and Tyrek, and then Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella if you count them.

As far as Baratheons go, Robert and his two brothers, Renly and Stannis, lived in King's Landing until Jon Arryn's murder, which made Stannis to leave. 

And King's Landing is a city, not a castle."
TheEld,"The Free Folk do not use ravens to send messages, and there are no true towns or cities north of the Wall."
TheEld,"Thank you. People are acting like this season is no different from the previous ones, but the fact that it is no longer directly based on what happened in the books is showing painfully in the coincidences, lazy plot devices, and out-of-character moments."
TheEld,Just like  A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. A Storm of Swords was a climactic book. A Dream of Spring will be the second and final climactic book.
TheEld,Theon is 21 or 22.
TheEld,Not now it seems.
TheEld,13
TheEld,"What incentive is that? And no, Castle Black never gets any news from Meereen in the books."
TheEld,"What has Brienne done in the show that it better than everything she does in A Feast for Crows? Rorge, Biter, Nimble Dick, Hyle Hunt, Randyll Tarly, Septon Meribald, the elder brother, the gravedigger, Shagwell, LSH, Jaime at Pennytree, Tymeon, Pyg, Gendry.. Come on, dude. Just my opinion."
TheEld,"In the show Margaery would be the heir to Highgarden if both Mace and Loras were out of the picture. In the books, of course, Willas is Mace's eldest son and heir. "
TheEld,You see her bare ass in Season 3. But I'm pretty sure there is sex in Star Wars.
TheEld,About 14 years ago. So it ended about 3 years before Robert was crowned.
TheEld,Varys does not help Tyrion after he leaves King's Landing. 
TheEld,http://img.tel.pmdstatic.net/fit/http.3A.2F.2Fphoto.2Eprogramme-tv.2Enet.2Fupload.2Fslideshow.2Fgame-of-thrones-saison-5-le-tournage-a-debute-en-croatie-7966.2Fptvs-30022485615-c2-135574.2Ejpg/1000x699/quality/65/roger-ashton-griffiths-mace-tyrell-et-mark-gatiss-tycho-nestoris-sont-de-retour-dans-cette-saison-5.jpg
TheEld,Good point. No idea. None of this is from the books so I'm just as lost as anyone else. Might be yet another inconsistency from this season.
TheEld,"Maester Aemon doesn't have an egg with him at the Wall, as far as we know. As a youth, Aemon and his brothers, Aerion, Aegon, and Daeron were all given dragon eggs. None of them ever hatched. [AFFC Major Spoiler](#b ""In any case, Aemon leaves the Wall in the books and dies on a ship called the Blackbird in the Narrow Sea."") Also, dragonglass is just obsidian. It isn't anything made by dragons. Also.. [MAJOR FREAKING HUGE SPOILER ADWD](#b ""Jon gets stabbed to death and dies, so.."")"
TheEld,"Season 5 has pretty much been about 95% ""new"" content so far already."
TheEld,Probably not.
TheEld,Viserys did teach her about the Faith and the Seven.
TheEld,"George has no idea what Reddit is. He barely knows how to navigate the internet. When he needs to research something, he has people that do it for him."
TheEld,"The insect was a manticore. Manticores have a poisonous sting that is fatal to humans and kills the instant it reaches the heart, unless a clotting agent is used to thicken it and delay its fatal effects. As far as the nonsense with the creepy little girl, I dunno. Apparently it had something to do with the warlocks and their magic. Nothing like that was ever in the books. A sorrowful man (the Sorrowful Men are a Qartheen group of assassins) does try to kill Dany with a manticore in the books, but it is while she is still in Qarth, where access to manticores is much easier, since they live on islands in the Jade Sea."
TheEld,I had to stop the episode and go back to that shot just to confirm that there was seriously no Dragonpit.
TheEld,Only in the show.
TheEld,Nope. The show has forgotten she existed.
TheEld,"The Winds of Winter will be out before Season 6 airs, but he still won't be writing for Season 6."
TheEld,Because there hasn't been a single shot in any trailer with anything like that in it.
TheEld,Yes. Asha is currently still holding Deepwood Motte. 
TheEld,"Well, I guess we really don't know what happened with the dog. We just have this quote from Jeyne:

""Tell him, you tell him, I'll do what he wants...or whatever he wants...with him...or...or with the dog or...please...he doesn't need to cut my feet off, I won't try to run away, not ever, I'll give him sons, I swear it, I swear it..."""
TheEld,A mockingbird. Mockingjays don't exist. This isn't The Hunger Games.
TheEld,At least Tyrion mentioned Thoros this season already.
TheEld,"Yup. None of that nonsense happens in the books. As you can see by my flair, I love the Sparrows in the books. It is an outrage how they are being portrayed in the show. They don't hate gay people, they don't care about drinking, they never kill anybody, they don't care if you worship different gods than them, they don't try to shut down any brothels, they don't carve things into their foreheads, etc. All they want is to help the poor, speak out against the corrupt, and protect the weak from oppression and the horrors of a war-torn country. "
TheEld,But why would you think there was anything magical about greyscale?
TheEld,He's been cut from the show like so many others. He is supposed to be a vital part of Jaime's arc but that isn't going to happen now.
TheEld,"There is no character named Arianne Sand. And I'm mainly thinking of the Sparrows, who arose out of the aftermath of the war due to septs being burned, septas being raped, etc. They are a very sympathetic group in the books, but in the show they're just crazy bloodthirsty zealots who hate gays and don't want people to have any fun."
TheEld,"The book explicitly says he did.

""Westeros had seven gods at least, though Viserys had told her that some septons said the seven were only aspects of a single god, seven facets of a single crystal. That was just confusing. The red priests believed in two gods, she had heard, but two who were eternally at war. Dany liked that even less. She would not want to be eternally at war.""

-A Game of Thrones"
TheEld,It is in her contract. After Season 3 Emilia Clarke said she would never be nude again in the show. 
TheEld,"In the books Dany is only 15 when she meets Daario, who is in his early thirties. Daario is much more flamboyant and charismatic in the books. He looks like this, and that should tell you all you need to know: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/7/7a/Daario_naharis.jpg

Basically, she is a young girl infatuated with a confident and attractive man who also heaps compliments on her. It should also be said that Daario is a huge scumbag in the books. He really is a bloodthirsty cutthroat, much more so than his show counterpart. She knows that he is no good for her, but he is her escape to fantasy, pretty much.
"
TheEld,Changes are fine and necessary for time and budget reasons. It is only when the changes are illogical or make no sense story-wise or are direct contradictions within the show itself that I get pissed off. And that has happenned far too often.
TheEld,When she slaughtered Shagwell. Even though he thought himself too droll to die.
TheEld,"Most of the inhabitants of the Red Keep are not Lannisters... Cersei is there becaus she's the queen, Jaime is a Kingsguard knight, and Lancel and Tyrek are Robert's squires."
TheEld,"As a book reader, so did I. None of this nonsense is from the books."
TheEld,For the same reasons people used to think you could get AIDS from skin contact. People are afraid of diseases and don't really know how they spread. There is no germ theory in Westeros or Essos.
TheEld,"I mean, you could also count the fact that she's a very different character with an extremely different personality as well in the show."
TheEld,The Wall is only about 700 feet tall at its highest point. And archers on the ground with longbows or recurve bows could certainly shoot targets atop the Wall even at this height. The arrows would simply only be going about 35% as fast when they got there as when they were fired. 
TheEld,"There is no evidence of that, and it wouldn't make much physiological sense."
TheEld,To the show it is.
TheEld,"Rhaegar+Lyanna=Daenerys and  Brandon+Ashara=Jon
"
TheEld,"When we first meet them in A Game of Thrones, Joffrey is 12 and Jon, Robb, and Gendry are all 14."
TheEld,GRRM has nothing to do with the dialogue in the show.
TheEld,"Well, there has been literally nothing in any of the trailers showing any sort of battle at or near Winterfell."
TheEld,Ramsay makes Theon perform oral sex on Jeyne and then he has a dog rape her.
TheEld,"Apparently not, as we've seen. And there is all kinds of hoop-jumping going on because of it."
TheEld,"Good point. Nobody carves anything into their bodies in the books. It just goes along with trying to make the Sparrows seem like terrorists in the show. That's a good question, though."
TheEld,"For the same reason they aren't introducing ""Aegon"", Jon Connington, Wyman Manderly, Euron, Victarion, Penny, Reznak, Arianne, Quentyn, etc. Because they want to simplify and finish the show in seven seasons."
TheEld,And neither of them were ever trying to put Dany on the throne.
TheEld,The Many-Faced-God is only associated with the Stranger. Asha is also certainly not a maiden. And Gendry is not even in A Dance with Dragons.
TheEld,Her knights? Olenna doesn't command any knights. 
TheEld,Except they're right outside Winterfell now.
TheEld,"Because he wasn't a Targaryen supporter when Season 1 was written. He isn't one in the books, and it wasn't until recently that the writers decided to make him one in the show, hence things don't make the most sense as a whole."
TheEld,Jon isn't helping Stannis do anything.
TheEld,You really must not understand what people are complaining about.
TheEld,That's because it was just something made up on the spot by the writer.
TheEld,The reveal that Catelyn Stark has been resurrected.
TheEld,"""the actor is southern""

wat"
TheEld,"All the rapes actually depicted on screen:

Craster's wives getting raped by the Night's Watch deserters.

Polliver's men raping the innkeeper's daughter.

Dany raped by Drogo

Mirri Maz Durr getting raped by Drogo's khalasar

Theon getting raped by Myranda and the other girl.

Jaime raping Cersei

Ramsay raping Sansa"
TheEld,*Sigh* It's only one of the most significant chapters of the series as far as the overall story is concerned..
TheEld,Dungeons and Dragons.
TheEld,And Jaime trying to sneak in to kidnap her does nothing but make her about a hundred times less safe.
TheEld,He sees the episodes for the first time when everyone else does. He isn't a writer and has no say whatsoever in any decisions the writers make.
TheEld,Probably not your kind of show if you thought that was boring.
TheEld,"He murdered two innocent young boys, one of which may have actually been his son. "
TheEld,Astapor.
TheEld,At least there was no dog involved like with Jeyne.
TheEld,"This is quite an old quote and has nothing to do with the Sansa rape scene in the show, which George also had nothing to do with."
TheEld,"[MAJOR SPOILERS/GEORGE'S ORIGINAL PITCH](#b ""Arya, Bran, Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys will survive the entire series."")"
TheEld,George R. R. Martin had nothing to do with that.
TheEld,"I would say the biggest vacancy is the portrayal of the effects of war that was featured so heavily in a feast for crows. The book made a strong case against revenge, especially from characters like Ellaria, who has been turned into a psycho rage-monster and child-murderer in the show. Everything is about revenge, lust for power, and boobs."
TheEld,"Jaqen is dead.

"
TheEld,What? Of course not. What does feudalism have to do with slavery?
TheEld,Is rape worse than murder?
TheEld,How much have you written?
TheEld,There will be seven seasons. There are 24 episodes left.
TheEld,He did show that in A Storm of Swords. Reread Arya's chapters.
TheEld,Pretty obvious.
TheEld,"Books:

About 10,600 Unsullied (around 2,000 of which are young and not fully trained).

2,000 Windblown

About 4,000 Brazen Beasts

About 6,000 freedmen who fight

500 Stormcrows

About 200 pit fighters who want to fight for her 

26 of Barristan's squires

About 20 Dothraki warriors

So around 23,000 people in total are hers right now.







"
TheEld,"Well, House Thorne is a house from the Crownlands."
TheEld,She's in Winterfell. And neither Winterfell or Moat Cailin are cities.
TheEld,It makes no sense. David and Dan have even joked about how everyone has jetpacks and cell phones this season. They don't care.
TheEld,Tell me everything. Now. Who dies? What is revealed about the Others? How do everyone's stories end?
TheEld,"Greyscale usually only affects children, but there is another form that affects adults and is fatal. Children who contract grayscale are immune to the fatal form, however. There is also another similar fatal disease known as the grey plague that acts much faster."
TheEld,A governor of a castle.
TheEld,No?
TheEld,"Just plain awful. Same names but different people entirely. They didn't even try to get their ages, hair colors, or ethnicities right. And they should be having absolutely nothing to do with Ellaria. And they certainly should not want to kill Myrcella. The whole thing is bad fan-fiction at this point. And another thing... Apparently Ellaria is Tyene's mother in the show. Ellaria is not supposed to be the mother of Obara, Nymeria, or Tyene. "
TheEld,He's not dead.
TheEld,All you see is Theon's reaction. 
TheEld,"""Aegon"" is not a Targaryen."
TheEld,Baelish
TheEld,Nobody knows because none of this is in the books. The Faith isn't supposed to really care if people are gay. 
TheEld,He has a very bad case of gout that makes it extremely painful for him to walk.
TheEld,"Jorah never gets greyscale in the books. Nobody ever goes to Valyria, there are no stone men in Valyria, etc. etc. But as far as we can tell, Greyscale is a waterborne pathogen that can also spread from person-to-person through bodily fluids, which means through open sores as well. When you contract the disease, you won't know it until weeks later when your extremities or face first begin to show external signs."
TheEld,"Sansa is still married to Tyrion in the books. He does have her undress and he really really wants her, but he ultimately resists doing anything to her."
TheEld,He's just messing with you then.
TheEld,"It would still have to be nullified by the High Septon or a Council of Faith, though."
TheEld,Nope. They only know to fly one way. 
TheEld,That's because he is.
TheEld,"No, of course not. It makes so sense in the show, as you can see, but in the books Varys is not a Dany supporter. He's trying to put Illyrio's son, a Blackfyre, on the throne."
TheEld,The Greatjon is still a captive at the Twins.
TheEld,Wildlings do that all the time.
TheEld,"What? Everybody is not in Westeros and of course there are all kinds of different nations, cultures, people groups, etc. in Essos."
TheEld,He hasn't written an episode for Season 5 and he isn't writing one for Season 6.
TheEld,George has said he plans for The Winds of Winter to be on shelves in less than 10 months. He is very close to finishing it.
TheEld,"Dany currently has about 10,600 Unsullied (about 2,000 of which are still very young and have not completed their training). She also only has about 20 Dothraki warriors. She wouldn't stand a chance without dragons."
TheEld,Just another inconsistency to add to all the rest.
TheEld,Tyrion's storyline in Season 5 is not based on the books very much.
TheEld,Gregor.

TheEld,"Grenn, Pyp, Barristan, Pyat Pree, Mance Rayder, Jojen, Joyeuse Erenford, Xaro Xhoan Daxos, Rakharo, Irri, and Mago."
TheEld,Margaery doesn't really do any politicking in the books. Cersei's biggest enemy is her own paranoia.
TheEld,That person with her in the shot from the trailer is Tommen. And Olenna has absolutely zero authority over Tyrell soldiers.
TheEld,Baelish is almost certainly behind the assassination attempt.
TheEld,... How?
TheEld,Why would we stop watching it when we enjoy bitching about it so much?
TheEld,Don't associate Martin with Game of Thrones. That isn't his story. 
TheEld,"""Why didn't they just take Kingslanding during the war and kill all the Lannisters.""

Because then Stannis would be king and Margaery would just be the daughter of the lord of Highgarden."
TheEld,I think you need to reread that epilogue.
TheEld,Because then they couldn't keep getting infant boys.
elbruce,He said that to Cersei.  Ellaria wasn't there.  Is everybody assuming that all the characters in the show are watching the show?
elbruce,"Theories count as a kind of spoiler, yes."
elbruce,Oberyn was all about revenge.  He just wanted it to be targeted exactly to the right place.
elbruce,"No, there are literally dozens of you."
elbruce,"Yeah, it's not like they need good reviews at this point. The show's got plenty of momentum.  And four episodes was way more than necessary anyways.  Most shows just do 1 or 2, if that."
elbruce,This might actually have been an improvement.
elbruce,Turncloak?  Broken man?  I thought you said no spoilers.
elbruce,You'd almost think Margaery was drawing her out on purpose...

elbruce,"You should change your flair to ""only loyal to the king when convenient."""
elbruce,"Yeah really, if they're going to cut extraneous scenes, that one should go."
elbruce,"Yep.  If Dany wants to keep ho's in different area codes, who's to stop her?"
elbruce,"Probably ""advisor"" with respect to his court."
elbruce,"Davos put him in a boat and said ""follow the coast and you'll be in King's Landing soon.""  We have not seen a scene showing that he was thwarted in that plan.  Therefore, he's in King's Landing.  This stopped being funny a few seasons ago."
elbruce,"[Book Spoilers, sorta.](/b ""Maybe not a beast, but definitely a squealer. Roose says he finds the noises she makes in the sack 'quite charming.'"")

Walda's very well set up, if you have expectations appropriate for the society rather than applying our expectations to it.  So she and Roose aren't very emotionally close and her husband has all of the emotional range of a great white shark.  She don't care, that's kind of the norm (especially if you grew up a Frey).  She's the Lady of Winterfell, wife to the Warden of the North.  You can count on one hand the number of people with a higher social position than her in all of Westeros.  Walda has *nothing* to complain about.

That is, until/unless Ramsay starts murdering her babies..."
elbruce,"That's OK, it was actually the information I clicked into here to find."
elbruce,"I'd rather have it fully come out in the story (either books or TV show) than some ""confirming"" hint."
elbruce,He should have an open line of credit with them.

elbruce,They do cool moves in movies or TV shows.  This ain't a documentary.
elbruce,"Maybe.  I mean, Essos does extend off the right edge of any known map.

Or it might be that she needed to get her dragon trained and another khalasar following her in order to finish up the Meereen quest so she can get a move on."
elbruce,"I don't think that was the reason.  I think they wanted him to visit Oldtown before he died, and probably introduce Sam there for training."
elbruce,"Out of all the factions, only Stannis' is fully aware that the White Walkers are going to come to destroy every living creature on the face of the Earth.  In light of that, just about any action is justified.  They're literally trying to save the human race."
elbruce,"That's the *overt* meaning.  It's literally what he was talking about.

OP is clearly suggesting that there's a meaning other than what Aemon was intending..."
elbruce,Just enjoy the acting.  Michelle Fairley gives the performance of a lifetime.  Everybody else is exquisite too.  It's like watching a really amazing version of a Shakespeare tragedy.
elbruce,"1. Yes, Bran did.  I didn't say otherwise.  However, Jon only knew Bran was alive.  Bran and Rickon had already split up before Bran ran into Sam.  So Sam only knew about Bran, and told Jon.  Therefore: Jon didn't know about Rickon, just Bran.
2. In the show, Sam and Jon discussed where Bran could possibly find food and warmth within enough of a walk to survive, and they decided that he could only make it if he stopped off at Craster's.  That's why Jon volunteered to go there."
elbruce,"It was just a question of ""too much, too soon.""  If we'd gotten to know them better before they start acting all badass fierce grrl stereotypical and giving backstory monologues, it would have played better.  Give 'em time, I'm sure they'll grow on us. "
elbruce,"*HA HA WOMEN AMIRITE?*

^^^^^/s"
elbruce,"I think you missed what she said: ""We all know who the first casualty of that war would be.""  As in, the moment you start, they'll kill Margaery.  That fact hasn't changed."
elbruce,"No, he has to send Sansa's head back to get Cersei to OK it.  I don't think he'll do that.  So even that request was another double-bluff."
elbruce,"Because at this point all of the complaints are that something happened other than what they wanted to happen.

I'm just glad Ramsay didn't light it anyways and use it as a trap to capture Brienne."
elbruce,"&gt; shaping up to be

That means the same thing as ""so far.""  Aka ""nothing yet."""
elbruce,"She doesn't despise her exactly.  It's just that A) Cersei *has* been horrible to Margaery in the past, B) Cersei is an awful person in general, and C) Cersei is making it clear that she's not going to give up running the kingdom even though Tommen is legally an adult.  Which means she gots to *go.*"
elbruce,"Actually there aren't 12 moon cycles to a year on Earth, there are a bit over 13.

However you can easily measure a solar year even without seasons by using the stars, as most ancient cultures even on Earth have managed to do."

Was that his purpose, to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests? When he spoke of how sweet the peach was, did his words have some hidden meaning?' The king gave a shake of his head, like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck. 'Only Renly could vex me so with a piece of fruit. He brought his doom on himself with his treason, but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brotherâs peach.'"")"
elbruce,"Remember when Cersei said there were only two of that lion pendant, one on her and one on Myrcella?  An eagle-eyed user in this sub caught a still of Sansa in S1 or 2 wearing it.  It's the one Joffrey gave her.  Also, it showed up well before Ellaria could have sent it, since he had *just* tried asking Doran to do something and been rebuffed.  Which means Cersei faked the threat in order to send Jaime down there.  All he has to do is see that Myrcella is still wearing the lion pendant to realize that Cersei duped him.  That'll sour him on her.

I'm still holding out hope for LSH.  But to be honest there's still plenty of time to introduce her, even into next season depending on how much they cram in from the books.  I mean, they still haven't touched the Iron Islands; they could go well into season 6 on what they've got already."
elbruce,"It's not going to happen that way, but I like it.  Reminds me a bit of the *Pern* series by Anne McCaffrey, in that you get multiple novels in before realizing it's actually hard sci fi instead of fantasy.

Actually this could be the loose basis for another fantasy novel entirely."
elbruce,"In the Song of Ice and Fire RPG, yes."
elbruce,The main evidence for it is that GRRM used similar phrases to describe some of their characteristics.  But writers sometimes accidentally recycle phrases without realizing it anyways.
elbruce,"I think she wanted a shadow demon baby to take to Castle Black.  The're trying to give the already-established characters more screen time, so one more ""Jon resists temptation"" scene kinda makes sense, after Stannis and Davos tried already.

We have yet to see her use any kind of healing magic whatsoever.  None of the Red Priests seem to have the same spell selection, beyond perhaps flame divination.  There's no evidence that she can heal or resurrect anybody at all."
elbruce,"They could just use the book material and do a few long episodes, like *Sherlock,* or they could make it a traveling ""on the road"" episodic thing where they go from town to town and have a completely separate adventure each week, like *Kung Fu.*"
elbruce,Recently Stannis gave a speech where he explained his position in detail regarding people wanting to kill or otherwise get rid of Shireen.  You should check it out.
elbruce,My problem with Brienne is that her plot clearly wasn't going anywhere.  Just back to yet another chapter of her going door to door asking if anyone has seen a maiden of three and ten with chestnut hair.  No?  I'll try the next door...  It's a plot thread that wandered off into a dead end and kept going.
elbruce,She has hipbones like coathangers.
elbruce,"Don't know.  Arya's entire experience there might be custom-tailored to break her down without her even realizing what's happening.  It seems likely they're *1984*'ing her in some way.  I'm assuming that every interaction she has there is intentional.  For whatever psych-profile reason, whoever's in charge of her training program may have decided she needs to interact with someone also in training who seems to be ahead of her somewhat and mistreats her.

In fact, the OP image just made me realize another possibility I'd never considered: what if the blonde girl isn't a trainee at all, but a full-fledged FM posing as one?"
elbruce,"I don't know what books you've been reading or what show you've been watching, but Barry ain't no Tyrion."

elbruce,Why would she think that?  Sansa vanished from KL during Jpffrey's wedding while LF was half a continent away (as far as anyone knew).
elbruce,"Oh, there were *plenty* of screen-caps of that shot.  Photoshopped various ways, put up against various other scenes, etc.  This sub was pretty much nothing but those two scenes juxtaposed for a week."
elbruce,"If it weren't for Cersei and all the other shit going on, Tommen would make a great king provided he still has Margaery as queen.

The Tyrells have been doing really well with Mace leading their house.  Mace is a sweet nice guy, not a mean bone in his body, seemingly way in over his head with all these ""vipers"" around him.  And he doesn't seem to even notice they exist.  Someone could cleverly insinuate to his face that they're going to rip his head off and shit down his neck and he'd be all like ""ho ho, what a witty jester you are!""  That's because he's lived his life surrounded by Tyrell women to take care of all the intrigue and backstabbing for him.  Tyrell men just take care of administration (occasionally war) and can just go on assuming that everybody gets along with everybody else, all the people love them, and every problem just works out by itself somehow.  Because the ladies make sure it works out that way whenever the men aren't looking.  Mace has had a great life, and his house has prospered enormously under his tenure.

I think Tommen would make an *excellent* king version of Mace, with Margaery around to take care of the intrigue and backstabbing behind the scenes.  He's a genuinely nice guy who to be honest would rather not know certain things and wouldn't look too closely under rocks that should be left unturned.  That system has worked extremely well in the Reach, I don't see why it wouldn't benefit the Crown just as much.

Unfortunately, all that other shit *is* going on.  Cersei is preventing Tommen from getting set up with a situation that would be perfect for him.  Stannis, Dany, and the Martells are out there.  So sadly he's never going to get a chance to become the Tyrell-style king that he's perfectly suited to be."
elbruce,"Birth it there, yeah."
elbruce,"Maybe not any time soon, but I don't see him making it to the final round of the Game."
elbruce,I like it.  But Bran told Osha to take Rickon to the Last Hearth.  I'd want an explanation for how they ended up at Bear Island instead.
elbruce,"The people in Dorne plan to go to war to make Myrcella queen because in Dorne girls inherit over younger brothers.  Somebody tries to abduct her and she ends up with a big scar across her face. 

Another Dornish plan is to send Doran's son Quentyn to visit Dany because they were secretly betrothed when she was born.  He does.  Then he tries to set her dragons free and they roast his punk ass.

There was one guy ""Griff"" who is secretly Aegon Targaryen (Elia's son switched at birth with a random baby by Varys) travelling with a mercenary company who secretly serve a secret bastard line of Targaryens.  Tyrion was travelling with them instead of Jorah.  They play Westeros' version of chess a lot.  ""Griff"" is also supposed to try to marry Dany, I think.

The old king from the Iron Islands falls off his bridge and dies.  His brothers show up.  They have a big meeting to decide who the next king will be.  Much pirate badassery ensues.  Misogynist pirates don't like Asha(Yara) so she charges off on a mission to prove her badassery and immediately gets captured by Stannis.  One of the pirate uncles sets sail to go find Dany with a magic horn that's supposed to control dragons, maybe?  He probably wants to marry her too.

When Tyrion gets to Meereen it's being besieged by ridiculous slave armies from all of the other free cities.  He and Jorah get captured by the same guy and forced to become slave entertainers.  There's a massive outbreak of a horrible disease (not grayscale, but definitely lethal as hell) going on everywhere killing people off left and right.  Nothing happens except suckitude everywhere.

Danny marries Hizdar.  When they open the fighting pits, somebody tries to poison Dany but it didn't work because she wasn't hungry.  Nice plan, assassins.  Then DROGON OUTTA NOWHERE shows up and starts roasting people.  Dany jumps on his back and they fly away.  She hangs out at Drogon's cave for a while trying to figure out how to better control him.  Then she and her dragon meet a horde of Dothraki.

Arya is given a potion that makes her blind.  Then she gets a bunch more training.  Then they un-blind her, after she wargs into a cat to be able to fight without seeing.  She often dreams of being a direwolf leading a giant fucking pack of wolves around the Riverlands.  She then learns how to practice acting as other people, being observant, and coming up with clever plans to kill people.  Then they teach her the face trick.  It involves magic and actual faces cut off of dead people.

Sam, Gilly and Maester Aemon set sail to Oldtown but somehow get stuck in Braavos for way too long.  Gilly's baby was switched with Mance's baby; she has his, and hers was left behind.  She bawls at the top of her lungs for the entire book.  As soon as they manage to fina-fucking-ly pull away from Braavos, Maester Aemon goes ahead and kicks the bucket.

A bunch of guys from the Night's watch stab Jon to death with daggers over him importing the wildlings and wanting to go help fight in Stannis' war.

Stannis' army gets buried in a fuckton of snow and collectively freeze their asses off before even getting to Winterfell.

There's a bunch more, but those are all the plot threads I can recall at just this moment. "
elbruce,Let's all ask ourselves if we think Jorah is that lucky...
elbruce,"&gt;  1v1?

I don't think you understand the concept of how armies work."
elbruce,"Once you fully understand what they mean by ""I am no one,"" you'll realize that it literally does not matter."
elbruce,"Well they offended the shit out of Stannis, but fuck Stannis."
elbruce,Rickon aged up.
elbruce,I don't think it's very flattering to have Ramsay be a subscriber to /r/fatpeoplehate.  He's kind of what they remind me of anyways.
elbruce,"We don't know how Varys intended to introduce himself and Tyrion to Dany.  Maybe he had a letter from Illyrio, or maybe he had something I haven't even thought of planned out.  It's a moot point now though, since Jorah fucked it all up."
elbruce,Sure he should have.  Shoulda woulda coulda.  Congratulations on having hindsight and access to the books.
elbruce,"I like to think that they did it solely to fuck with Tyrion and Bronn, and wipe that smug look off of their faces.  It worked."
elbruce,Thinking of increasingly insane and implausible shit has become something of a competition over at /r/asoiaf.
elbruce,"I don't agree that Craster was necessary at all.  But it was Jeor's call to make, not mine."
elbruce,"The books, like the show, only rarely show anything fantastical.  However they have a lot more historical and mythological information which unlike our own fairy tales, one can reasonably assume to be true, because magic is real.  That said, due to the lack of magic for so long, most of the characters don't really believe in that stuff."
elbruce,Their first recital.  They really want to make Dany proud.  They've been practicing all season!
elbruce,"Except that **nobody tells Robert what to do.**  Lancel was ordered by *Robert* to give him wine, like constantly.  Offering him booze was pretty much Lancel's entire *duty* to the throne.  So what if it's strong or weak?"
elbruce,"Because the men in the show never get hurt.

This is basically puritanism, demanding that all stories be morality plays in which the only people who ever suffer are those who deserve to (according to whoever's talking at the moment).  Those don't make for compelling or interesting stories though."
elbruce,So goes the theory.
elbruce,"I think she thought she had more time on her side to work him.  She can't just suddenly start yelling at Tommen left and right to do this or do that, or else she risks ending up with a Robert/Cersei style marriage."
elbruce,Seems like their M.O.  They take characters we've already gotten used to and loaded them up with elements and roles that were taken by new characters in the books.  Helps give the favorites more screen time.
elbruce,"Strong Belwas may not move plot, but he does brighten up scenes.  Maybe he could be still introduced as a pit warrior.  Not that I'm holding out much hope."

elbruce,GoT isn't going to kill someone off screen.  If he was dead they would have made it really obvious in the scene.  They aren't into wasting opportunities for gore.
elbruce,"I'm sure we'll see her again; while not fully A-list, that actress is too well known to only be cast for a single scene.

However, I'm glad that GRRM is a better writer than all the people who think ""Red Priest/ess"" is the cure for any and every plot problem because let's assume all of them can do anything."
elbruce,"First of all, IMDB is often wrong about things that haven't actually come out yet.  It's not like any show is forced to submit accurate advance information.  And if they want to avoid spoilers, they've got a lot of reason *not* to give IMDB that information.  So there's zero reason to trust them.

But they could still do LSH later on.  When you think about how much other material they're presenting, it's putting a lot of things off, perhaps into season 6.  This season is focusing on introducing a lot of new Dornish characters.  [AFFC](#b ""There are a lot of new Ironborn to introduce as well, and those may have to wait until season 6 so people aren't having too many new things thrown at them at once."")  There's plenty of time to get around to LSH, if not this season then even in next season.  Since they only cast and write for and inform the actors one season at a time, nobody would know yet."
elbruce,"[All books.](#b ""You know what's way more annoying?  Seeing scene after scene of people on the road never ever reaching their destination, and nothing of consequence ever happening (another conversation on a boat?  wow) because everyone is still on the road, for thousands of pages at a time.  Be glad they're skipping irrelevant travel details, because the contrary is worse."")"
elbruce,"""I mean, say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos."""
elbruce,[I'll tell you who.](http://i.imgur.com/P7uTwKn.jpg)
elbruce,"They actually did train quite a lot.  But you go ahead and make assumptions.

Look at the gif above.  The problem with the dagger girl was that she was way too close.  If she were advancing from further back it could have looked more threatening and Bronn could have extended his sword cut instead of pulling in.  But then she would have been out of frame.  That's not her fault, that's on the director.

If you watch the Oberyn/Mountain fight again, you may notice that each film cut lasted on average less than a second.  That scene is Franken-edited together like crazy (to spot actual good fight-scene skills, look for long takes).  It's sad to think that the Sand Snake scene was made from the best footage they had.  The rest must have been laughable.

The problem was that no matter how much money you have, you don't get to use that location for more than they got.  They had 1 week to film all of the Water Garden scenes for the entire season.  Good fight choreography takes more time than that.  Also, the direction for fight scenes seems to really suck this year.  But blaming the actors for that is just silly, and demonstrates a severe lack of understanding of film production."
elbruce,"You keep talking like just because you haven't seen something *yet* means you'll never see it.

They're trying to not introduce too many new characters at once or juggle too many plot lines at once.  So they'll resolve the current Dornish plot line before bringing on the Ironborn."
elbruce,"Whatever the sparrows' opinion is towards Cersei has yet to become clear.  For the moment, she saw to them being able to create their own military force, so she's useful.  For the moment."
elbruce,"Also, it's not like there's a law forcing production companies to submit accurate cast information to IMDB in advance.  And they have no incentive to post spoilers for their own show."
elbruce,There could be more showing up in just a few more seconds.  Barry just happened to be closest.
elbruce,The only people complaining about it are book readers.
elbruce,"Yt's alle Olde Ynglysh lyke thet.

Blame the Welsh.

I find blaming the Welsh helps with most things."
elbruce,"I find it weird when people blame characters for outcomes they couldn't have possibly predicted.  *The characters to not have copies of ASOIAF to reference before making their decisions.*

Well, except for Jojen.  But that didn't help him much."
elbruce,"All he did was kill a couple of peasants and a couple of resisters.  In GoT's world, that's nothing."
elbruce,"Yes, people have typed that multipole times.  But what they've said is that they've discussed his outline.  And GRRM has said his outline isn't complete."
elbruce,"Storm's End has thicker walls than Harrenhall.

But Harrenhall has an enormous amount of downsides.  For one thing, it's way too big to be supported by the lands and population around it.  It's impossible to mount enough soldiers to properly defend the entirety of it, at least not without it being a massive drain on your money and resources.  As a result, most people who've been in it only use part of it and leave the rest unmanned and empty.  That's where the rumors of ghosts come in.  There's a long and unlucky history of people who've controlled Harrenhall (probably all coincidence), and a whole lot of creepy rumors about it among the smallfolk.  To the nobility it's considered a burden, and tends to act as a  ""white elephant"" that gets passed around repeatedly by royal decree before being given up on, reverting to the crown, and then passed around again.  That's why Baelish was able to get it on the cheap.  But he didn't really want the castle, just the title attached to it."
elbruce,"It's a horrible position.  They've basically got everybody he cares about as hostages, and he's got no decent advisors to rely on, he has no real talent for strategy, and hasn't been trained up for rulership the way Joffrey was.  He's fucked."
elbruce,"Or Stark blood, to be honest."
elbruce,"It took her a while to get through the conquering tutorial, considering she started standing outside the gates of Qarth with nothing.  And that didn't go nearly as smoothly as it could have (the Warlock side quest was a distraction).

Now she's still early in the rulership tutorial, which starts with chaos and insurgency.  She's far from finished getting through it.

Once she's got that completed she can start the main ""Westeros"" quest."
elbruce,"Michelle Fairley, Red Wedding, best acted scene ever."
elbruce,He must be in contact with them if he knows their opinion.
elbruce,"If anybody tries to burn Shireen, Stannis is going to make them *wish* they were next on the pyre.

Why does no one get that?  It's *exactly the entire point* of his monologue!  He straight up basically said ""everybody wanted to get rid of you and I told them all to fuck off."""
elbruce,Growing bound to get the friction on.
elbruce,I don't think either of them have in quite a while.
elbruce,He took down their whole fucking crew.  I'd say he did pretty damn well for himself.
elbruce,"I was just thinking what the best play for him would be, and I think it would be to walk into the Iron Bank and say ""Cersei says she isn't paying back one more fucking red cent and says you can all go fuck yourselves with a Valyrian steel sword.  Sorry, I'm just quoting.  So, by any chance were you considering having her assassinated...? 'cause just sayin, House Tyrell would be cool with that.""  Then come back to KL and tell Cersei he's negotiated great new terms and the IB gave them a new lower rate.  Basically, she just put a lot of potential power in his hands."
elbruce,What's really hardcore about it is the use of a real severed human hand to sew onto her hip there.
elbruce,"She already gave them everything they need.  They don't ""need"" her any more."
elbruce,"""And the best part is... he's *learning.*"""
elbruce,Coming up with increasingly insane theories has become almost a competition in its own right at this point.
elbruce,"Yeah, they should just give her her FM diploma and then she'll instantly be super-badass."
elbruce,"It works better in the books because Cersei is the only POV character there, and she's the source of all the tension.  No matter how much you might dislike her, just the fact that you're reading it from her point of view while she claws and scrapes to hang onto what power she has left makes it play out as tense."
elbruce,"The Tarlys are Tyrell bannermen, silly."
elbruce,"Remember when that snake in the sand was about to bite Jaime and Bronn killed it?  ""Shit way to die, that."""
elbruce,The Roose has been Loose since before this show began.
elbruce,They should make a spinoff show called *Gendry's Island* with all those characters.
elbruce,"Honestly, when Tommen looked back at the people gathered behind him yelling, it looked like a moment of calculation to me.  He was like ""this could escalate into some Joffrey-scale bullshit, best tap the brakes.""

Yeah, he wants to solve the Loras problem but it's going to take a bit more than just marching straight to the place where he is and demanding him back immediately.  Or else there's going to be widespread blood in the streets.  It's not too much to ask Loras to chill for a bit to avoid mass rioting."
elbruce,"This isn't something that's happened in the books.  But it can be easily theorized from what we've seen so far in the TV show.

1. Arya is in Braavos
2. When she was chanting her kill list, Meryn Trant's name was on it.
3. Meryn Trant is going to Braavos."
elbruce,Oh no.  People on the Internet are complaining about something...
elbruce,"They're clearly going there.  Some show-only watchers are beginning to guess R+L=J without having ever heard of it before.  I'm not sure when or how it'll be confirmed (since the books haven't even done that) but it's very much becoming a thing.  

If the show is doing it, then it's sure to be true in the books as well.  GRRM has the scope and time to craft a complicated red herring; D&amp;D don't.  If it weren't going to be true, they wouldn't waste time giving us more clues that point towards it.  And certainly not so many clues all at once.

&gt;  Why is Sansa standing at her aunt Lyanna's crypt, anyway, rather than her father's, or her uncle Brandon's, or her grandfather Rickard's?

I could theorize that since she's (yet again) in a situation where she's being held by bad guys, she's trying to draw strength from Lyanna who (as far as she knows) was also being held by bad guys."
elbruce,Nah.  He'd want to talk first.  And in talking the desire would go out of him.  I think he was just talking shit because he was pissed off.
elbruce,"This is why I was unhappy with the change from how it was done in the books.  The book version of the vote, Sam basically tricked the other candidates into throwing their votes to Jon as part of a complicated multi-round voting strategy."
elbruce,"It's actually ""plotting to support the king making unhealthy choices."""
elbruce,"He might or might not die, but he'll definitely get busted for it.  The Sparrows have yet to execute anybody though.  Maybe public shaming, limited punishment and penance is enough for them.  We'll see."
elbruce,"&gt; Get hyped

So D&amp;D are going to do Cleganebowl in S5?  OK, what even the hell."
elbruce,"He's about a year old.  He was born about 10 episodes ago.  So that's over a month between each episode, which is perfectly reasonable.  And would give Littlefinger enough travel time while it's at it."

elbruce,"Ho ho, of course not!  House Tyrell remains perfectly trustworthy and harmless, and so is its Lord.  No snakes in these grasses, wot wot?

elbruce,"Dunno, but check this out - follow the right edge of the map up from Ulthos and you find Carcosa."
elbruce,The smoke monster shadow demon baby that killed Renly was no potion or party trick.
elbruce,At least she wasn't monologuing.
elbruce,"It's not an ""absolutely everything"" thing.  Assume that what was supposed to happen offscreen happens *unless* a scene shows you how the plan went awry.  We don't need to see someone taking a shit to assume that people (other than Tywin) ever shit.  We don't need to see someone get out of a boat after they got in a boat or else we should assume they're rowing forever.  If something was deviating from plan, that would call for a scene onscreen.  If we *don't* see that scene, then we can assume it went like it was supposed to.  Gendry ""still rowing"" or ending up somewhere else would be a major deviation, and should therefore be an incredibly important plot point, if it wasn't shown to us.  I don't see how it could be a major plot point."

As populist as he is, the High Sparrow never said that the reputation for honor of everyone at every station of life is considered equal.  That's your thing you added."
elbruce,"Plus, if she has a baby they won't need her any more.  They'll have Stark blood in their lineage and her usefulness is at an end."
elbruce,"We have yet to see any grumpkins or snarks in the show, so he might still be right about those."
elbruce,"Which makes him expendable, now that the show dragged him back into a dangerous mission."
elbruce,What if it was Sansa's old room...?
elbruce,"Probably Dany, but they wanted to leave it ambiguous."
elbruce,"""The young Varys &amp; Illyrio chronicles,"" but definitely a Robert's Rebellion epic miniseries."
elbruce,Because everything any character says is a prophecy that *has to* come true.  There's a point beyond which that stops being good foreshadowing and becomes bad plotting.
elbruce,"The Dorne mission is a lot more *focused* than ""Jaime handles random organizational problems and runs around Westeros fixing GRRM's loose ends."""

elbruce,"Yeah, in Ramsay terms, ""hurt"" means ""permanently maim."""
elbruce,It's gonna be like *Murder on the Orient Express:* everybody did it.
elbruce,"1. Littlefinger was hundreds of miles away in the Vale when Joffrey died, and had been for months.  Or at least as far as anyone knew.  Due to the presumed distance, he's among the last people anybody would connect with it.
2. Roose has yet to announce publicly that Sansa is up there.  He will soon if he wants to get those wedding invitations out to the northern lords, but afaik he hasn't yet.
3. If push comes to shove, Littlefinger can just tell Cersei that it's an impostor Sansa.  His niece Alayne is pretending to be Sansa in order to help the Boltons bring the north in line.  Littlefinger gets his blood married into the Bolton line in exchange for helping them secure their realm.  She'd fall for it.

Remember: the people in the story aren't watching the show or reading the books.  They don't know the things you know.  It's important to consider what they don't know all the time."
elbruce,Pretty much every AA theory is a desperate attempt to explain why it shouldn't obviously be Dany.
elbruce,"I'm not saying they're generally ignorant of everything.  Mace is actually excellent at finance and administration.  It's just that even the ""best"" Tyrell male is kept out of the loop when it comes to *intrigue* - backstabbing, plotting, alliance/rivalry strategies - all of the shit that houses like the Lannisters do openly."
elbruce,"People keep claiming Melisandre is evil, but she's not.  She sees the big picture clearly.  There's a zombie apocalypse coming, and when it sweeps down none of the petty politics over who rules what is going to matter.  In the face of the extinction of all humanity, burning a few people is worth it.

But this scene, when she was actually putting the case to Stannis for burning Shireen, seriously gave me some Azor Ahai vibes."
elbruce,Just what I was thinking.  It shows how much power is spiraling away from the center.

elbruce,"Yes, she is certainly guilty of ""hoping"" Robert died."
elbruce,Not according to Romeo and Juliet.
elbruce,I think they're trying to avoid flooding the screen with too many faces at once.  They're basically taking turns with all the new characters that need to come in.  Dorne is up first.
elbruce,"What I'm interested in is how much more of her we're going to see.  That actress was Rila Fukushima, who plays Katana on *Arrow.*  She's not a huge star, but she's way too big of a name to only have in a single scene."
elbruce,"Because 

1. Jon didn't know about Rickon, just Bran.
2. The only place Bran could have gotten to before freezing was if he stopped off at Craster's.
3. Jon looked at Crasters and didn't find Bran.  Then he burned it down.

As far as Jon could know, Bran is dead.

I would like to take this moment to remind everybody that the characters in the books haven't read the books."
elbruce,"""Serve my Lord"" is Melisandre speak for ""gonna tap dat."""
elbruce,"&gt; 3 people were able to speak with her alone.

Where did they say that nobody else ever spoke to her?

You're doing the ""if I didn't see it it never happens"" thing, which would also imply that the only person on the show who has ever taken a shit is Tywin, and then only once."
elbruce,"I used to disapprove of everybody (Robert, Cersei, Tyrion) treating Lancel like shit all the time.  After last night's episode, I think I'm up for a rewatch just to watch them all kick him around again."

elbruce,"The Unsullied aren't supposed to be badass 1-on-1 fighters.  On a battlefield they make a really badass unit because they never break ranks.  Any battle is far more about getting your opposing side to turn and scatter than it is how many people you kill.  Once one unit breaks ranks, the other can mop up its individuals easily.  The thing that makes the Unsullied scary good in battle is that no matter of many of them you kill, the rest will re-form their line and keep working as a unit.  Long after any other army would have given up, shit themselves and ran off in random directions.

However, this doesn't translate to policing narrow streets in small groups."
elbruce,There are always supposed to be 7 of them.  Just because the show hasn't shown each individual appointment doesn't mean they aren't being replaced as necessary.
elbruce,"I think Trant will want to have Mace be seen there.  It'll take a little bit to get him away from witnesses and come up with a good excuse to make it look like a Braavosi sellsword got to him.  Then while Mace has his back turned and is sampling some exotic pastries from a stall, Arya will quietly perforate the fuck out of Trant and drop his body into the canal.  Then Mace will turn around and go ""Meryn?  Where'd ya go?"""
elbruce,"Thanks to this sub, I now want to see Gendry, in a background shot, with his fucking head on a pike."

elbruce,"She says right at the very beginning of the scene that Doran wanted to ease his concerns over her safety and treatment.

Remember, Doran, the guy who runs things there, is the one who *doesn't* want to start a war with the Lannisters.  Jaime is going to be just fine.  And it's not like he thinks Jaime wants to hurt Myrcella."
elbruce,I'm sorry. 
elbruce,"No, it was part of the ceremony.  ""Theon of House Greyjoy, ward to Eddard Stark"" is who is giving Sansa away.  Reek would have no standing to do so."
elbruce,"The cure they mentioned was have every Maester and healer in Westeros treat you while you are a small child, and even then get very very lucky.  That's not an option for Jorah."
elbruce,"A nitpick:

Theon is a ward, which is more than just a hostage.  Remember, Ned and Robert were wards to Jon Arryn.  Littlefinger was a ward to House Tully.  None of those were for ""hostage"" purposes.  While the ""hostage"" advantage does apply in Theon's case, the main point is to form lifelong friendships for the next generation, an ""old boy's network"" as it were.  

Robb and Theon were very close; if everything had gone according to plan, there would have been a lasting friendship forged between the future Lords of Winterfell and Pyke that would last at least for the next generation, if not longer.  It was a very long-term strategy to forge a lasting peace with the Iron Islands."
elbruce,Death &amp; Defenestration.
elbruce,"Tywin is the only person in the Seven Kingdoms ever to have taken a shit, and it killed him.  After all, if they never showed anybody else ever take a shit to you on the screen, apparently you have to assume nobody else ever has.

As opposed to doing the reasonable thing and thinking through what would be most likely thing to happen if it wasn't being shown to you on the screen."

The rules only apply to everybody else."
elbruce,"I think he'd be cruel, oppressive, fair, and just."
elbruce,"Why would the blacksmith do that?  All he knows is that he sold Gendry to the Hand of the King a few years back.  That Hand later got decapitated for treason, so presumably Gendry is unemployed now and could go back to his job.  That was a few years ago.  Some guards *were* looking for him (or at least ""some guy with a bull helmet"") a while back on orders of King Joffrey, but Joffrey is dead now too.

Nobody left in King's Landing knows who Gendry is, *except* for that blacksmith.  And not even he knows why anybody cared about Gendry to begin with."
elbruce,"Reminds me of the Bill Cosby / Carlos Mencia joke about how the dad spends years teaching his son to play football from an early age, he grows up to be an NFL player, wins the Superbowl, then thanks his mom."

His inability to act is basically making a laughingstock of his rulership.  One that everybody will take advantage of.  Cersei's plan is going to demolish Tommen's reign much faster than Stannis ever could."
elbruce,"Some of the ancient legendy stuff seems to suggest that all the creepy monster stuff invades Essos from the far eastern edge of the map, beyond Asshai, rather than from the north, as with Westeros.  I imagine any cold weather itself comes from the top down, though."

Although it might depend on whether they're using Baratheon-style or Targaryen-style (male uncles before daughters) inheritance for the throne."
elbruce,"In the show he has a conversation with Sam where they're looking at a map and trying to figure out where Bran could have gotten to, and decide Craster's is the only place.  Then almost immediately the issue with the Craster's mission comes up.  But Jon definitely had two purposes in going there."

elbruce,"He's back in his ""don't use the CGI budget"" shed."
elbruce,"I don't think the show is really getting into keeping track of who all of the Kingsguard are at any given moment.  There are 7 of them (including Jaime and Trant), they're top-level knights appointed as necessary, and that's all the show needs to keep track of."
elbruce,"After all the clues they dropped last episode, that picnic conversation between Ned &amp; Robert is worth a rewatch."
elbruce,"It was a train wreck of bad plans.

Fortunately Doran saw it coming because he's *not* an idiot and sent his dude to be ready to shut all that bullshit down."
elbruce,"She wasn't actually part of that group, but she does follow the same God as Thoros of Myr, who is.  However, there really isn't any consistency among red priest abilities.  Thoros can't make shadow babies, for example.  In fact, other than possibly reading visions from flames, I don't think there's one ability in the entire chronicle that any two red priests share.

If resurrection was that common, you'd think we would have heard more about it, because it would solve most peoples' problems most of the time.  First of all, people would have heard about it; there'd be rumors everywhere about what the red priests can do.  Second of all, Cersei would have definitely called for every red priest they can find to come bring back Joffrey (now there's a disturbing thought: zombie Joffrey).

Rather, I think Thoros calling the resurrection energy into Beric was a one-time inexplicable ""miracle.""  Now that it's here, whoever is carrying it can be resurrected repeatedly (Beric, then LSH) but if it were just a ""spell"" that any red priest can cast whenever they want, you'd think there would be tons of resurrectable people running around by now."
elbruce,"Not only that, she was born at Dragonstone island during a huge storm at the same time Robert was killing her dad at the Trident.  She also hatched the dragons from their stone-like eggs (waking dragons from stone).  I think she's so obvious that the other character matches are desperate red herrings to throw us off the trail."
elbruce,"No it wasn't.  They've discussed his broad outline (such as it is, which we don't know).  But that's far from having a detailed schematic of everything."
elbruce,"Yes, obviously.  ""Benjen is Daario"" is repeated solely as a joke to make fun of tinfoil theories in general.  Nobody actually believes it.  If anybody says they do, they're lying because they think it's funny to say they do."
elbruce,Jon tried to find Bran.  He figured the only place Bran could have gotten to where could have survived was Craster's.  Jon went to Craster's and didn't find Bran there.  So he assumes Bran is dead.
elbruce,"""You must go back to go forward.  You must go East to go West."""
elbruce,"There's only about 1 season's worth of material for a Dunk &amp; Egg show.  However, it lends itself to episodic content really well, so they could add a lot of one-off adventures and then use the adapted material for season finales and long-arc overlays."
elbruce,That would be pretty awesome.
elbruce,Two days without hair product and *foomf!*  It ain't easy being Margaery.
elbruce,"Ah, theories..."
elbruce,"Even in the books I wasn't thrilled with Robb.  I didn't dislike him or anything, I just thought ""the son inherits the lords from the father, forms an army and attacks their enemies"" made him kind of a stock/standard character.  If he had succeeded it would have been a really boring way for the good guys to win.  When people freaked out over him dying I was like ""meh.""  Catelyn was a much bigger loss for me, as she was a much more interesting character.

You know who pisses me off is Rickard Karstark.  He puts a sword in his son's hand, sends him into battle, his son dies, so then he spends the rest of the time bawling like a little bitch over his son falling in honorable combat.  Acting like he was murdered at home or something.  Robb should have shamed the fuck out him early on for being such a whiny pussy.  As well for dishonoring his son's service to the war effort."
elbruce,"I completely agree.  A while back I figured out how to calculate plot armor.  If a character isn't necessary to move the story forward, they can die.  If their death would create a dead-end that makes having told this story thread pointless, they won't die.  So for example, Bran has plot armor because if he died you'd have to ask why so many chapters were wasted on his journey North; it would be *bad writing* to have done so.

I don't think Bronn is needed in the books or the show.  He was given his ""happily ever after"" scenario and then dragged back away from it into the fray."
elbruce,Seven hells.
elbruce,"They made a radio out of fucking coconuts.  &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

Alternate possibility: the Professor could have got them out any time, but kept them all trapped there for his own nefarious purposes..."
elbruce,"The very fact that the world parallels historical sexism with such little power for women is what makes the exceptions so interesting.  Women like Melisandre, Dany and Brienne (and even Cersei) are overcoming huge social obstacles to live as they do.  That's what's heroic about them."
elbruce,"Probably because she had just chosen to enter into a legal contract requiring the production of an heir, with strong customs regarding wedding nights.  

Their society is not our society.  There are some admittedly shitty things about it that people have to put up with.  But nobody in their society goes around *blaming* husbands for having sex with their wives on their wedding night, as not only expected of everyone but also *required* of nobility.  That kind of moral judgement is not part of their world.

It is part of ours (and it should be!) but you aren't exactly being productive or informative pointing out things in their world that are considered moral crimes by our standards.  That would make for a very long list, and is irrelevant in any case."
elbruce,"I don't think he was thinking about Brienne when he said it, but if that ends up being the case it would make the line poetic after the fact."
elbruce,"&gt;  For all we know Melisandre could order Sansa burned alive for worshipping the wrong religion.

So Stannis loses control of the Northern houses?  He puts a lot of stock in Mel's advice, but he isn't an idiot."
elbruce,"Sort of, maybe kinda.  I mean technically yes, but some people might not agree and those people might back one of those kids to try to fight him for the succession.  If Ramsay wants to make sure his inheritance is *certain,* then he'd want to kill those kids."
elbruce,"There is zero evidence of this whatsoever.  If he is alive, he's hundreds of miles away, at peace and retired from a life of fighting.  The only reason anybody even remotely thinks Cleganebowl could happen is because they want it to.  Not because there's any reasonable chance of it occurring whatsoever."
elbruce,Red Wedding; Michelle Fairley should have got an Emmy for that shit.
elbruce,"I think you're putting way too much discount on political marriages.  You *want* to marry your kids into power positions.  That's *good* for them.  It hasn't always worked out that way here, but the matches you're complaining about were excellent scores.  And giving Stannis a bonus because he's failed to betrothe Shireen to anybody  doesn't help either.  A betrothal would give her an additional political alliance and further protection after he's gone.  He isn't doing her any favors like this.

&gt;  Theon and Jon were his wards, and by extension, his children.

If Stannis had wards, he wouldn't see it that way.  And Ned treated Jon pretty well.  Far more than most highborn lords treat their bastards.  And if serving the Night's Watch was good enough for his uncle Benjen, it was good enough for him."
elbruce,"If Bran were running Drogon, King's Landing would be ashes by now."
elbruce,Admittedly the show has set that bar pretty fucking low by now.
elbruce,"Technically, she doesn't.  The moment Tommen married Margaery he came ""of age"" and any official Regent position expired.  Go back to the Purple wedding episode for proof, everybody was throwing that fact in Cersei's face back then.

Unofficially, until the day Tommen says ""mother, I disagree"" to her (about anything whatsoever) she can ride by on her rickety fake authority.  But it's going to make the Crown look incredibly weak for as long as it last.  The sooner she accepts retirement, the stronger the kingship will be."
elbruce,"And she's all like ""dick or not, I'm getting in bed with ya!"""
elbruce,"I'm not going to *assume* that things that didn't happen in the story happened in the story.  It's possible it could turn out that way.  But it's not obvious nor even the most likely scenario.  You might as well literally make anything up for every character to have happened between scenes and write your own damn story.

It was one thing when it was a ""wouldn't it be funny if"" speculation, ha ha.  Then it was funny for people to kinda act like they believed that was the outcome, ha ha.  But people keep pushing it like they actually think they really do believe in it.  You don't."
elbruce,I'll have you know that is Lord Baelish's establishment!
elbruce,"DAE hate Sand Snakes?!?!  LOL!  Like if agree, Share if want them dead!"
elbruce,Are you feeling OK?  You seem a little grumpy today.  Perhaps it's time for a nap.
elbruce,The Ironborn strike me as little bitches in the books too.
elbruce,I've had some sex that made me feel like that for at least week.  Just sayin'.
elbruce,"Robert may have a lot of bad qualities, but he wouldn't rape a betrothed high-born woman, especially back then.  Ned wouldn't have been such good friends with him if he was that sort of person."
elbruce,"Considering that everybody who knew about his parentage in King's Landing is dead or elsewhere, he could probably go right back to the blacksmith shop where he was working and get his old job back.  Ned didn't tell the blacksmith why he took him or what he wanted with him, so Gendry could just say he got laid off due to employer decapitation.

Not that they *will* write him back into the show, but if he's chilling in King's Landing, they could easily bring him back into the action any time they want.  With D&amp;D going completely off the rails relative to the books, they might actually choose to exercise that option.  Their main goal right now seems to be recycling old characters over introducing new ones, to keep fan favorite actors on screen as much as possible."
elbruce,[This explains everything you need to know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLNFloNdJH4)
elbruce,I thought of that being because of how many times Ramsay gave him hope for something good and then turned around and tortured him even worse if he went along.  It's what trains him to assume that any hope must be a trick.  We see the first example when he thinks Ramsay's helping him escape and leads him right to the torture chamber instead.  And we see how it works out in his mind when his sister tries to break him out and he won't go along.
elbruce,"*""Hello darkness my old friend...""*"
elbruce,He's a nice guy and they could have a perfect Tyrell style marriage with her pulling all the strings and him remaining clueless and happy.  Just like her dad.  If Cersei wasn't fucking everything up.
elbruce,"They've only got so many characters per scene, so many scenes per episode, and so many episodes per season, to tell this huge epic story.  They've been trimming that down by re-using characters who are already pretty thoroughly developed in place of introducing new ones.  I think it's a natural consequence of being mired in your existing set of expectations (gotta kill people!  gotta have spectacle and sex and suspense!) but I think even more people would complain even more loudly if they *didn't* keep up expectations.  But I honestly can't picture in any detail how to do this job better than they are.  I like to imagine that adapting the most unadaptable work in the history of fiction is something I'd be better at than them, but then again I can't dunk on LeBron James either."

elbruce,This is an all spoilers scoped thread.  Go nuts.
elbruce,It's his wedding night.  You think Ramsay is *not* going to get it in on his wedding night?
elbruce,"I'm not saying I personally deem it as morally good.  But in the world they live in, that's the moral norm.  And it was in our world right up until a couple of centuries ago.  Of course something is less horrifying and shocking if you have most of your life to mentally prepare yourself for it."
elbruce,"Except for the other time they were mentioned, as cited in the comment you are replying to."
elbruce,"I think we need to get some time with the characters before we get the big backstory monologue, so that we care.  Plus, I'm pretty sure the other SS's know Obara's story by now, whether I could kinda see Stannis having never talked to Shireen about her disease before now.  Because I already know him.

It's classic clumsy writing to *start* with the big speech to introduce the character.  Show them being badass, get the audience invested, and *then* give us their big speech about where they come from and what they care about.  Then it'll actually hit home."
elbruce,"It's hard to truly dislike Jorah because all of his worst flaws, as bad as they are, are a lot like things I've done in the past too.  He's just *really* bad about women.  He gets overly hung up on women he shouldn't try to be with, and then he makes incredibly stupid choices to try to get or keep them.  We've all done those sorts of things in our own past relationships, although most of us get over that level of stupid well before we get to his age.

Other than that (which is impossibly to truly dislike him for) he's an all-around great character."
elbruce,"If your lazy half-idiom usage indicates the exact opposite of what the full idiom is trying to get across, then you're not communicating well.  And insisting that everyone go along with your upsy-down language makes you the biggest"

Might be I'll die before they work it out."" 
"
elbruce,We can't know whether it serves the broader story yet.  So everyone who says they know that it does or doesn't is talking out their ass.
elbruce,"The more major a character is to future books, the more D&amp;D will have to juggle if they remove that character from play now.  They do have an outline of where GRRM is going in the future.  I think Jaime is likely to remain a key player going forward.  Bronn, not so much."
elbruce,"It's funny, every time the show drops a bunch of reminders of something leading up to it being relevant, everyone complains that they've dumbed it down too much.  But every time they *don't,* people say that'll never happen because they haven't been dropping enough reminders lately."
elbruce,"I'm still pretty sure the snake in a box thing was *made* by Cersei to manipulate Jaime into going after Myrcella.  If Myrcella still has her lion pendant, that'll confirm it."
elbruce,"Actually, that's equally as important.  Massive wars have been fought over dynastic disputes, with thousands upon thousands of people dying over them.  Leaving any Targeryens around means eventual eventual civil war and widespread misery and slaughter."
elbruce,I think they're working their way up through the Tyrells to get to her.
elbruce,"Personally I had a hard time keeping track of so many of the new late-game plot lines while also keeping track of the plot lines that had already been established.  Quentyn, Griff, the Sand Snakes, a whole pack of new Iron Islanders... my comprehension dropped somewhat because I wanted to hurry up and find out what happens to the characters I *already* cared about.  I realize not a lot of people had the problem I did (or it doesn't seem like it from what I'm hearing) but I imagine a lot more would have that problem in a TV format.  So trimming down the plot lines probably helps with that.

Remember: there can only be so many characters per scene.  There can only be so many scenes per episode.  And there are only ten episodes per season.  That's a fact that can't be wished away.  Something's gotta go."
elbruce,"&gt; They've assumed their tv audience is too unintelligent to keep up with a large cast.

It's not that they think people are dumb, it's just that keeping track of lots of people visually works differently in our brain than keeping track of written information.  How many times have you heard ""and also starring a hundred bearded guys who all look the same?"" as a critique of the show's earlier seasons?  The simple fact is, that a cast of hundreds of named characters can't be made intelligible in under ten hours of screen time per year.  If you think they can, that's only because you've read the books and *already know the information.*"
elbruce,Aaand it got invaded by /r/fatpeoplehate.  Great.
elbruce,"Van Oster would call in to the DEA office when they didn't come back, if only to find out who the hell was taking the next shift.  At which point they would realize that Huell was the last person to have seen Hank and Gomie alive.  They would then bring him into the office to question him about that and he'd describe his last conversation with Hank.  Then they'd let him go because they actually have no reason to keep him and know of nobody to protect him from.

This is so fucking obvious, it's just a matter of applying ""what would happen if this were actually a real world with its own continuity.""  People take shits that aren't filmed.  When they get in a car in one scene and arrive somewhere else in that car in another, we can assume they drove the intermediate distance in that car.  If someone gets in a boat and is rowing to place X, you can assume after a certain amount of time they got to place X even if you didn't see their fucking boat land.  We don't need our hand held and to see literally every tiny detail on the screen in front of our eyeballs or else we have to assume they *didn't* happen.  That's utterly fucking imbecilic.

Rather, we should assume the *most likely* outcome is going to happen by itself *unless* we see an unusual plot point to change that.  Davos sent Gendry rowing to King's Landing.  Therefore Gendry is in King's Landing.  He's probably working as a blacksmith again, because that's what he tends to do."

Enjoy!"
elbruce,"&gt; I'm not sure why critiquing necessitates having my own version

Because the only way to support your claim that something is unnecessary is to demonstrate its substitute.

&gt; Why does Reek need to go over the edge? 

He might or he might not.  If he does betray Ramsay for Sansa, he'll be just about the only asset she has in Winterfell.

&gt; He's been submissive for so long, why would seeing his kind-of sibling being raped stir feelings in him? 

One could theorize lots of reasons, but clearly it did.

&gt; Sansa already has reason to get back at Ramsay. He's been a dick to her the whole while.

She *just met* the dude.  And ""being a dick"" doesn't warrant a major revenge scheme, which is what I'm hoping for from Sansa.  If Ramsay doesn't earn whatever she's going to end up doing to him, people are going to claim they don't like her character any more, trust me.

&gt; I haven't read the books, so I don't know what it'll happen

I have read them, and I have no idea what will happen.  This part in particular is a very major deviation."
elbruce,"Entertaining read, good analysis.  Thanks."
elbruce,Good thing I never made it past step 1!
elbruce,"My theory is that Nymeria will be the reason Arya retains her identity after her training.

I'm sure the FM have dealt with trainees who hid a personal belonging somewhere before now.  They've probably got a long history of dealing with that, and clearly they're good at what they do.  But it's quite possible - likely even - that one thing their training program can't handle is warging.  It's very rare in the modern age, and only seems to occur in the far north end of Westeros, which is extremely foreign to Braavos.

[AFFC](#b ""Arya is regularly having dreams of being a direwolf in the Riverlands leading a huge pack of wolves.  That is, she's still connected to Nymeria.  That's a magical link to her identity that would be immune to training programs."")"

havron,"I love Pyat Pree's story in the books because if you pay attention, you realize that he and three other warlocks were captured by Euron-motherfucking-Crow's-Eye leaving a ship from Qarth, and he killed one and fed him to the other three. I like to think that the dead one was Pyat Pree, though it's almost as satisfying if he was forced to eat one of his friends instead."
havron,"Agreed, except he was a smuggler, so there is that small dark stain on his past (which he duly paid for). That's something that Eddard would never have done. But, morally, he's right up there with poor old dead Ned."

havron,"House Tyrell is a rose because they are outwardly sweet but hide dangerous thorns if mishandled. Their homeland, the Reach, is also the breadbasket of the Seven Kingdoms, so it would make sense for them to choose a plant for their sigil. Their words are ""growing strong"" because they bide their time and slowly work their way up the ladder without arousing much suspicion because, really, who fears a stupid plant? Kudzu their way to power, as it were."
havron,"&gt;Margaery looks really hot

Always."
havron,I believe you may have confused this with a Sand Snakes thread.
havron,"Yeah, and you could conceivably do that while carrying a piece of stone, however small it needs to be. And then do that a ton of times in a row. If *someone* can make that journey, at all, then one could find enough other people who can and have them slowly transport enough stone to build the bloody thing. I'm not saying it's necessarily in any way particularly feasible, but it's certainly not *impossible*. Sure, it might take centuries and that might be too long for anyone to reasonably wait to get it built, but my point is that it physically could be done. I don't care how difficult it is or how long it would take or how absurd the effort would need to be. ""Impossible"" is a very black-and-white term, which does not apply here."
havron,"Would it, though? If Ramsay has been legitimized, isn't he just legitimate, not some form of ""conditionally"" legitimate? He would still be the eldest son, so wouldn't he trump any newcomers?"
havron,"I don't understand why Olyvar was so smug during that hearing. Won't the Faith Militant come after him for being gay as well? Did they grant him immunity or something? It hardly seems holy to grant exceptions to anyone. Unless his sins have been forgiven for his cooperation in doing the gods' work.

havron,"Oh, Better Call Saul is good! I assume you've already seen Breaking Bad?"

Then he (knowingly or not, but either way definitely unintentionally) brings the disease back to Meereen and kicks off some Pale Mare-level horrors in Slaver's Bay.

havron,"The problem is, that Obara monologue *was* from the books. It was just poorly executed on screen, and seemed to come more or less out of nowhere. In the books, it was part of a much more intricate scene than some random half-assed empty tent in the desert where she just bursts into heavy-handed exposition for no clear reason."
havron,I've heard Tommen's wedding referred to as the Golden Wedding.
havron,"Yeah, those torture scenes were certainly off-putting, but I don't think we as the viewing audience would have truly believed Theon's transformation into Reek without them. As difficult as they were to watch, we needed to see those scenes in order to understand just what could have turned him into the empty shell of a former man that he has become."

havron,"He had to fall, to lose it all."
havron,"Hard evidence? All Bran would have is his word regarding what he saw, which doesn't prove anything. He could be easily dismissed as a child with a fanciful imagination."
havron,"Are you talking about Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad? I believe the same could be said for either, especially Game of Thrones. I've read the books once (some twice; my reread is still in progress) and seen every episode three or four times, and I am still noticing new things. It's incredible.

Six Feet Under is about a family that runs a funeral home in Los Angeles, which is where series creator Alan Ball calls ""the world capital of the denial of death"". Every character is realistically complex, each with strong personality traits often in direct opposition to each other. There's the sort of emo teen who's actually creative and unique (not so trendy as you'd think), the selfish older brother who conceals a soft spot for folks in need, the gay younger brother (played by a younger Michael C. Hall, aka TV's Dexter) hiding a wild streak behind a prim and proper exterior, and the mother who's trying to keep it all together and her family life normal and uneventful despite how tragically impossible that is given the crazy circumstances they all live under. I'd tell you more, including something crucial that defines a lot of what happens in the show, but is first episode spoilers that honestly is much better as a surprise. You've got it free to stream on Amazon Prime, so I highly recommend you go and watch the first episode and then let me know what you think. It really hits the ground running and is excellent throughout, getting still better and better each season, building up to what is universally acclaimed as quite possibly the best series finale ever aired on television. Great stuff, I promise you. If you like dramas and human stories, you will adore it.

Yeah, not everything is on Amazon Prime, but so much is on there that if you have broad tastes, it is well worth it (plus, free shipping on nearly everything?? Heck yeah!). I'm a sci-fi buff, and having access to all the Star Treks, the X-Files, the new Battlestar Galactica (an absolute MUST SEE), and much, much more makes it worth it alone, as far as I'm concerned.

I wouldn't say Adventure Time is anything like South Park; there is satire, but it's far more subtle. It really is a truly unique show. The closest thing on TV today I'd compare it to is probably Steven Universe (also a great cartoon) but even that doesn't come close. It truly does stand in a class by itself."
havron,"This isn't necessarily a problem. Plenty of organisms on Earth are genderless and still manage to produce offspring. Take most plants, for example. And earthworms are hermaphroditic, and they have sex and produce offspring all the time."
havron,"Oops, you're right, my mistake. Not hard to imagine her branching out into acting, though. It happens often enough."
havron,It is known.
havron,"&gt;Is it only a matter of time?

I see what you did there."
havron,Totally. I was so proud of him at that moment. Best lawyer in the world.
havron,"This. Yes, the rape scene in the first episode is significantly less rapey in the books, but most people don't read the books and the show portrayed it in a manner not unlike what we all witnessed Sunday night. That leaves the main difference that we have had four and a half seasons to become invested in Sansa's character, while Daenerys was new to us back then. So, what, are we only supposed to get upset when someone we know gets raped? Come on, people. This is a brutal world and brutal things happen to people who don't deserve them. Kudos to the show's creators and actors for portraying this horrible act with the weight it deserves. It *should* bother us! The fact that it is causing such a stir in the media is testament to the acting proficiency of the cast. Let's applaud them for getting it right, and then keep tuning in to find out what happens next. I for one expect Sansa to kick some Bolton ass soon!"
havron,"[theory based on synthesis of book knowledge and IMDB cast listings](#g ""I suspect Yara may be back very soon..."")"
havron,Not after blowing all their money on that bling.
havron,"Yes, it might be enough to set some things in motion, and maybe this could lead to a conviction ([AFFC](#b ""it certainly seemed to work that way in the end for Cersei"")). All I'm saying is that there is no ""hard evidence"" of such things in this world, a point which you seem to have agreed with me on here, so I think we're good. :)"

havron,Agreed. I have the same rule whenever I first listen to a new album: play the songs in the intended order first; shuffle comes later.
havron,"Oh, no, I always picture that, quite gleefully. And that chapter ends with one of my favorite passages:

havron,"This. May I remind my fellow book readers that at the current point in the books [ADWD](#b ""Tyrion has yet to join forces with Daenerys. For all we know, GRRM intends to kill off Barristan before that happens, to create just such an advisor vacuum."") We really just don't know. Let's give the story a chance to develop before we pass judgement, why don't we?"

havron,"So, they made sure to show Syrio, Tywin, and Jorah bald, yet left Unburnt Daenerys with hair. Huh."
havron,"&gt;""Youâve seen our numbers, Edmure. Youâve seen the ladders, the towers, the trebuchets, the rams. If I speak the command, my coz will bridge your moat and break your gate. Hundreds will die, most of them your own. Your former bannermen will make up the first wave of attackers, so youâll start your day by killing the fathers and brothers of men who died for you at the Twins. The second wave will be Freys, I have no lack of those. My westermen will follow when your archers are short of arrows and your knights so weary they can hardly lift their blades. When the castle falls, all those inside will be put to the sword. Your herds will be butchered, your godswood will be felled, your keeps and towers will burn. I'll pull your walls down, and divert the Tumblestone over the ruins. By the time Iâm done no man will ever know that a castle once stood here.â Jaime got to his feet. âYour wife may whelp before that. Youâll want your child, I expect. Iâll send him to you when heâs born. With a trebuchet.""

I will miss this speech most of all..."
havron,"Yeah, seriously: Don't just tag screeners with an easily-blurrable name in the corner; instead, hide subtle details in specific scenes, or drop random frames, or anything else that would be nearly impossible to detect a priori but easy to verify for those in the know. Make it hard for people to be sure they won't get caught leaking these eps."
havron,"&gt;You put on a face, and you wear it until it's the real you.

*A girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.*"

havron,*Those eyes* speak volumes on how fucked up he is. Alfie Allen is an incredible actor. I honestly don't understand how he portrays being so broken that well. Blows me away every time.
havron,Hmm...that doesn't quite seem like the same thing. His citizenship isn't what's in question here; it's his legitimacy.

havron,Good question. I am really hoping that a sizable piece of Theon came back from what he had to witness last night. I believe this is the beginning of his redemption arc.
havron,"Hey, no worries. It's not your fault the creators decided to blow so much money on dragon CGI this season that they couldn't afford stage lights."
havron,"It's not news, just fan speculation/hope. Absolutely nothing official regarding Mads possibly getting the role. But yeah, wouldn't it be spectacular? And yes, as long as it doesn't interfere with *Hannibal*, because gods damn is he perfect in that role!"

I mean, I'm sure it'll all pay off in the next book, but boy was it satisfying to see them finally meet here."") I am genuinely excited to see what happens next!"
havron,"Haha yeah, that would've been awkward. According to the rumors, that was a primary reason she turned down the role. But, again, I believe these were always just rumors that started simply because his sister just happened to be an actress."
havron,"Ok buddy, you asked for it. From Daenerys's final chapter in ADWD:

&gt;Sunset found her squatting in the grass, groaning. Every stool was looser than the one before, and smelled fouler. By the time the moon came up she was shitting brown water. The more she drank, the more she shat, but the more she shat, the thirstier she grew, and her thirst sent her crawling to the stream to suck up more water. When she closed her eyes at last, Dany did not know whether she would be strong enough to open them again.

can^not^wait"
havron,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked.
havron,Yes. This must happen. It's crucial to his character development.
havron,BOWLton GET HYPE
havron,"Great comparison. Though, I think you mean omniscience (all-knowing), not omnipotence (all-powerful). You can't actually *do* much of anything from within weirwood.net, but you sure can see a lot."
havron,"From Victarion's second chapter (""The Reaver"") in AFFC:

&gt;The Crowâs Eye filled two cups with a strange black wine that flowed as thick as honey. âDrink with me, brother. Have a taste of this.â He offered one of the cups to Victarion.
&gt;The captain took the cup Euron had not offered, sniffed at its contents suspiciously. Seen up close, it looked more blue than black. It was thick and oily, with a smell like rotted flesh. He tried a small swallow, and spit it out at once. âFoul stuff. Do you mean to poison me?â
&gt;âI mean to open your eyes.â Euron drank deep from his own cup, and smiled. âShade-of-the-evening, the wine of the warlocks. I came upon a cask of it when I captured a certain galleas out of Qarth, along with some cloves and nutmeg, forty bolts of green silk, and four warlocks who told a curious tale. One presumed to threaten me, so I killed him and fed him to the other three. They refused to eat of their friendâs flesh at first, but when they grew hungry enough they had a change of heart. Men are meat.â

Then, in Daenerys's third chapter in ADWD (which would be chronologically a bit earlier than Vic's above), a very much alive and not-locked-in-a-vault book-version Xaro Xhoan Daxos warns her:

&gt;âNot all your enemies are in the Yellow City. Beware men with cold hearts and blue lips. You had not been gone from Qarth a fortnight when Pyat Pree set out with three of his fellow warlocks, to seek for you in Pentos.â"
havron,"Ugh, right? Who does that? So much necessary map and music hype!

*Thrones, yeah, Game of Thrones, yeah, Game of Thrones...*"
havron,"Ah, so it is. Good find, thank you."
havron,Oh shit
havron,"Seriously, where did that meme start?"
havron,"*""You shouldn't be here.""*

Reek can sense the changes in the timeline. He is the Guinan of Westeros."
havron,Word to your grandmother
havron,"I know, and that's the beauty of it. Nearly everyone who hears those words thinks ""Pssh, dumbass fucking flower words for dumbass fucking flower people. Whatever."" when really they are cleverly announcing their intentions all along, just like how you know plants are growing around you but you nearly always ignore them because they're slow and quiet and unassuming. They seem harmless so no one suspects they pose a threat, just like the perfect pretty little plants they're supposed to be."
havron,"Wow, so they were. Thanks! Man, it's amazing what you don't notice when you haven't trained yourself to recognize an actor yet..."
havron,"Then what are you doing in a book spoilers thread?? =P

Well, if you don't mind being spoiled, it's from Jaime's penultimate chapter in the fourth book, *A Feast for Crows*. In that book, he is given the task of restoring order to the Riverlands and essentially cleaning up after the war (as /u/ProfessorBinns so eloquently puts it, his ""Bitchslapping the Riverlands Tour""). At this point in the story, the Blackfish holds Riverrun and Jaime has an army composed of former Tully bannermen including Freys (loyal to the Lannisters since the Red Wedding) and a very captive Edmure, who as the Tully liege lord Jaime is trying to get to command the Blackfish to surrender the castle. It's a pretty awesome scene, and this speech that finally gets Edmure to acquiesce is one of my favorites in all the books. Such a badass moment for Jaime, and a real shame to be cut from the show. It would have been so glorious to see on television."
havron,"That would be spectacular. Honestly I really thought something like this would be the perfect closing visual for the season finale, so now I'm worried about what we might be closing the season with instead..."
havron,"Hey, thanks! Sounds like they do meet up toward the end, and there's nothing precluding them staying together through the following book. We shall see..."
havron,"Aww, so sad that nobody watched Episode 6 this season.

Wait..."
havron,"Yeah, that was my guess, but it didn't seem like he had quite enough beard."
havron,"Totally. Terrible father, though..."
havron,"Good explanation of the disease. I think the merchant was likely in the early stages of it so it wasn't outwardly obvious (perhaps it had only advanced as far as a gloved hand), but he was still contagious."
havron,"Yeah you're right, there were some slow moments in some episodes of Game of Thrones, including ""The Climb"", but that speech definitely more than made up for them. And the lulls pretty much always made sense in context. Regarding Breaking Bad, the episode ""Fly"" comes to mind as one that at first made me wonder what the point of all that was, but then I realized it really showed just how obsessed Walt had become about what he was doing and how much he had lost sight of *why* he was doing it.

Cool! Six Feet Under is great. Let me know what you think after the first episode, and keep in mind it gets even better. There are some real gritty moments in the show, and some very real explorations of the nature of grief and loss that truly hit home for anyone who has ever lost someone they love. And plenty of great human drama first and foremost.

Yeah, I tend to get into recommended shows and binge watch them, analyze, rewatch, then finally move on to the next thing. I love getting completely absorbed into an engrossing fictional world. It's a diversion like no other. Six Feet Under, Breaking Bad, and Game of Thrones are among the best in that regard. The Walking Dead is a different beast entirely: an interesting concept with some compelling characters (but they could be better), but not always so well executed. I keep up with it, but it's definitely in a different tier than the truly great dramas. I'd put Vikings in that category as well, though there are times it is very Game of Thrones-esque and totally badass. I'd recommend checking out that one as well, but yeah, no Game of Thrones."
havron,"**This.**

havron,"Oh yeah, totally. That episode of Breaking Bad was well worth the character exploration. I enjoyed it, even despite my own ADD. =P

Yeah, I'm pretty much the same way. I usually only get into one serious drama at a time, but I do tend to watch a mix of lighter shows alongside. My usual pattern is one big drama and one more lighthearted cartoon as a ""chaser"". Too much heavy drama can weigh you down emotionally, so coming up to breathe a little joy is definitely helpful. And as for the drama series, I have actually found that taking your time to digest each episode is well worth it to give yourself time to mull over what you just saw, pick apart the details, and theorize about what might happen next (plus it makes the experience last longer). I love the weekly wait for new Game of Thrones episodes for just that reason. But, oh boy, when I'm catching up on a new show that's been on for a few years, you bet your ass I don't have the discipline to do that, haha. I'll just marathon it a few times in a row to catch everything. But, the new seasons are so much more rewarding due to the pacing. I generally watch the episode as it airs, think about it, come here on Reddit and chat with everyone about it, then watch it again right before the next one. And of course I periodically go back and rewatch entire seasons to fill in any lingering blanks I may still have, as well as giving myself a chance to catch any foreshadowing I didn't see before since I didn't know what was going to happen (and believe me, there is a fair amount of it, and it's so satisfying to notice in retrospect). But yeah, go ahead and binge watch Six Feet Under (I did). It's not like anyone can stop you. ;)

Hmm, looks like our convo is starting to gather a few downvotes. I'm thinking perhaps we should have moved on to PMing several steps back, haha. Feel free to PM me from here on out. I've never done that before, but I assume you probably know the drill."

havron,"As long as they can be king of the ashes.

Er, snow, I mean."
havron,"Yes. So, this would be a good reason for the show to bring him back late this season, and thus (hopefully) give us the epilogue from ADWD. He may have no patience for Cersei's foolishness, but one she is out of the way he would return for duty's sake. I suspect that if they had wanted to just write Kevan out of the show, they wouldn't have even bothered showing him at all this season. I doubt very much that many show watchers would have wondered where he had gone."
havron,"Nice! It really is a beautiful piece, and I badly want one. I first noticed it in S04E07, in the scene where Daario visits Dany in her private quarters and she commands him, ""Take off your clothes."" It was featured rather prominently when she pours herself some wine just before issuing that command."
havron,"No, I **D**on't."
havron,"As much as I would *hate* to see this happen, I would *love* to watch the fallout from it..."
havron,"I believe so too.

havron,GRRM praisefully commented that D&amp;D managed to take that horror he had written and somehow made it even worse.

havron,"One example that comes to mind: GRRM himself has said that he wished he had thought of having the moon door be set in the floor in the middle of the central chamber of the Eyrie, rather than just being an ordinary door set into the wall. Way cooler."
havron,"Oh, yeah, that scene absolutely was better in the books. It was very emotionally powerful and made me so angry, so it did its job quite well. I'm just not sure we needed to *see* all that on screen. Imagining it in my head was enough for me."
havron,Yes.

Also, Amazon Prime is a great deal. Might be worth renewing. If only Adventure Time were free to stream on it. As is, it looks like it's $1.99/episode, which is absurd given that they're each only 11 minutes long. But man do they manage to pack a lot into those 11 minutes."

havron,"Exactly. The man known to Arya as Jaqen changed his face when he gave her the coin and left her. He no longer needs that face, freeing it up for use by another."
havron,"Oh, no, it's quite different. Have you read that chapter (AGOT Daenerys II)? There is a long foreplay sequence and by the time the two of them finally get to doing the deed, she very clearly has decided that she wants it. Sure, some of their sex later on gets pretty rapey, but not their first time. I mean, yeah, it starts out that way, but it doesn't end that way."
havron,"Fair point, but I'm not so sure. If you read that chapter in its entirety, it's made pretty clear that, yes, Dany has no choice, but during that passage Drogo ends up being more gentle than she expected and, gradually, she seems to come to decide that, yes, she wants this. Not so much when he repeatedly takes her forcefully later on, of course, but in the end she comes to use her own powers to get what she wants from him. I am hoping that Sansa is able to do so as well but in a different way, manipulating Ramsay until she makes her move and exacts her revenge."
havron,"*Shit, this ball producing some sweet cream.*"
havron,"Wow, I never made that connection. I feel silly now."
havron,"No, I wasn't disagreeing with you at all. In fact I agree with you. It was a Mighty Boosh reference, in the first episode of which one of the main characters does precisely this to gain the attention of the woman he likes."

Episode 3: The Asian female red priest in Volantis mentions it (in Valyrian) during her sermon, and Tyrion comments about it (in the common tongue) saying, ominously, ""Stone men. Good luck stopping the spread of greyscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague.""

Buy them while they're firm and then, once a day, press your finger into the surface to see if the impression stays. Once it does, eat it that very day. If you are impatient, it's undersweet; wait too long, and it gets mushy and gross quickly. Totally worth the exorbitant price they tend to be sold at if you eat them at the right time!"
havron,I have come here to pour wine and kick ass... and I'm all out of wine.
havron,Right? It's flawless. Whoever made this really went the extra mile. Even the lighting matches perfectly.
havron,"Yes, the undead are called wights, but I believe the ""ice demons"" are properly called Others. It's always been unclear to me whether White Walkers was a synonym for those, or just a general catch-all term for both as a group. The show certainly seems to give the latter impression."
havron,"Yeah, until it needs to be a plot point. Let's hope not..."
havron,"You know, a lot of people are pushing for Mads Mikkelsen to play [S6 casting call info](#s ""Euron Greyjoy"") next season. So, hey, this might actually happen."
havron,"It would take a monumental effort, certainly, but that by no means makes it impossible. The ancient Egyptians managed to build the pyramids with quite primitive technology. I see no reason why a feudal society could not build the Eyrie given enough time and manpower."
havron,"When you go back and rewatch, his ascent to her council becomes much clearer. There are even multiple close-up reaction shots of him during the scene of Daenerys' arrival at the gates of Meereen in S04E03. None of us noticed then, of course, because we had no idea who he was; not even us book readers, who had no way of knowing that *that dude* was Hizdahr.

So many characters. It's a lot to track. Rewatching helps a TON."

havron,&gt;smote*
havron,"Agreed. And that panel behind her looks a bit eastern as well, so as others have said my guess is this is Tyrion with someone, perhaps a whore.

I was just commenting on the irritating lack of lighting in so many scenes this season. It's really hard to see sometimes, even with the brightness on the screen turned all the way up. I really don't understand why the creators have chosen to do this. I am hoping they ""remaster"" it for the Blu-ray and DVD releases. It just looks terrible."
havron,Yes. I would love to see some Red Wedding reactions done this way as well.
havron,"For all we know the books are ultimately going to do the same thing. [ADWD](#b ""By the end of ADWD, Tyrion and Dany haven't truly met yet. Maybe Barry is going to die in TWOW in time for Tyrion to take his place by Dany's side. We just don't know."")"
havron,*Clever girl*
havron,"Thanks to note curling and selective focus, all I can make out are the short phrases ""of further"" and ""[my?] establishment""."
havron,"Excellent point. I believe you may be right. My only hangup now would be whether Robert would be capable of believing Cersei did this, and whether he'd be willing to allow the realm to see both of them shamed for it."
havron,I never get tired of this gif...
havron,Would play. Shut up and take my money!
havron,"It would be so very Game of Thrones to show how truly in love Trystane and Myrcella have grown to be, and then to rip that asunder for a new plot."
havron,"Is it cool with HBO that they are releasing these before the actual episode airs, thus spoiling it? I don't get why this is allowed to happen.

But yeah, man, I am so pumped to see this!"
havron,"It's actually ""Ned **loves** my hair"" -- *present* tense. So much more heartbreaking that way. :'("
havron,"Oh, is she? That's kind of a relief. I never really looked that closely and always thought that was Violet. So, you can imagine my horror when I thought that revelation meant she was pregnant during the dog hunt. Of course, this just means we've added another woman to his boring -&gt; dead list. Hardly an improvement."
havron,"&gt;teleportation in the Sorrows

Whoah, really? Did I miss something when I read that chapter? Please elaborate, if you don't mind."
havron,"You hope [theory](#g ""Jorah dies"")? :'(

Seriously, though, thanks! I too think this makes enough sense that it not only could but *should* happen, and [speculation](#g ""it would make for a sad but fittingly dramatic end for our beloved explorer (after all, valar morghulis; the real fun and beauty is in the story). Also, as other posters have noted, having the new location of the repository for the stone men be specifically the ruins of old Valyria makes total sense on some level. Though it's far from the original book location of the ruins of Chroyane on the mighty Rhoyne, that is obviously out since Tyrion's riverboat adventure got downgraded to a wheelhouse ride with severely limited face-gazing options, and it just...feels right, somehow. Just picture it: The smoking post-Doom ruins, crawling with terrifying stone men! I think if GRRM had written it that way, no one reading the book would have complained."")"

havron,"I agree. I am about 90% sure this is how things will turn out. The ""hero's sacrifice"" music in that scene (and, truly, what a fantastic scene!) sold it for me. Barry the Bold has left the building. :'(

havron,"I know. And the area south of the Wall that is literally called ""The Gift"" wasn't even mentioned. Our two biggest predictions about the episode title were way off."
havron,"Martin only wrote one episode per season, except for this season when he declined to do so in order to focus on finishing the upcoming sixth book, The Winds of Winter ^^yay . He may have been consulted on others in the past, but I get the feeling that is less so the case now."

havron,"Well, it was about half verbatim. The first sentence more or less summarized the rest, but the book version was definitely better. I too thought I recalled him saying it in the show."
havron,Who are you talking to?
havron,IDK hat seals the deal.
havron,"*Maester Strangelove*

or:

*How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Play the Game*"
havron,"Ah, good point. Let's hope so. But, I wouldn't be surprised if they just cut that entire plotline (especially since Jaqen is in Braavos instead of Oldtown) and ""streamline"" it so that Sam just continues his studies at the wall.

Either way, I will miss rum-barrel-Aemon."
havron,"Well, my top three favorites who have absolutely nailed every single scene they've been in would be:

Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister)

Diana Rigg (Lady Olenna Tyrell)

Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister)

But the *best* actor on the show? Hands down, that would be Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy / Reek). How on earth does one act that *broken*? His portrayal of Reek just blows me away, every time (dear gods, the eyes...). A truly stunning performance from an incredible actor."
havron,"Olly growing up to be Batman

*I am the night*"
havron,"Dang it, who keeps moving all the rocks around?"
havron,Weird Al...?
havron,"Hmm, I'm not convinced that doesn't just make it sound like the two of them were fighting. I'm sure it's well known that the two of them have a less-than-ideal relationship.

Regardless, even if they do believe him, I still wouldn't call eyewitness testimony ""hard evidence"". That term should be reserved for physical proof."
havron,"But, but, we get Essos now!"
havron,"True. Whatever it would be, Robert would've done *something* about it."
havron,"Alfie is an absolutely stellar actor. How does one act *that* broken? Dear gods, the eyes..."
havron,"The first part of it is in S04E04, ""Oathkeeper"", in the scene between Sansa and Littlefinger on his ship:

""A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.""
"
havron,It will indeed be in this season. When it was filmed in Croatia it caused a bit of a stir there due to the public nudity required to accomplish it. They used a body double for Lena Headey.
havron,"Oh, right, when Dany is asking Grey Worm why an Unsullied would visit a brothel for companionship. But that scene has already happened on the show, and he just said ""I don't know."" I wonder why they left that line out? It is a good one."
havron,"Ha, yeah, I've thought of that, but I don't think there's any connection there. I certainly wouldn't call it GoT-esque, but it's a truly amazing animated show. It appears to be for kids, but oh no, it's so, so much more than that. Trust me, you're going to love it! :)"
havron,"That's later. Here's how their first time goes down:

&gt;He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and she looked into his eyes. âNo?â he said, and she knew it was a question. She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. âYes,â she whispered as she put his finger inside her.

Dany is afraid, but decidedly in control, or at least significantly more so than she appeared in that scene on the show. However, yes, it does sound like straight up rape later on. My guess is that the showrunners wanted to capture that later feeling in the first time, but that's not how that moment went down in the books. I was just trying to ward off potential criticism of comparisons between Sansa's and Dany's respective rape scenes due to Dany's wedding night situation being significantly different in the books, because really here all that matters is how the two scenes were portrayed on the the show, and that would be quite similarly."
havron,"Oh yes, you presented your perspective quite well, and in fact I agree with all of it. My central point was that Sansa is going through an ordeal not unlike what Daenerys went through at the beginning of the show, and I too hope that she can come out on top despite how terrible that ordeal will be. I feel quite confident that this is what is going to happen, as I simply cannot believe that we are simply seeing the showrunners continually hurting Sansa because it's fun for them. Nothing about what we are seeing happen to her right now is in any way good or alright, but I firmly believe that there will be payback and ladder-climbing once it's all over. I feel sorry for those who have prematurely decided to tune out because they were upset by this scene."

jymhtysy,killing roose is literally the worst thing anyone can do for the welfare of everyone at winterfell.
jymhtysy,I didn't say he deserved anything. :(
jymhtysy,"&gt; But wouldn't that be fun?

Oh.
Um

Absolutely not. I'd like to see it happen after the show, though."
jymhtysy,That is *not* a good thing to tell a flaying psychopath. 
jymhtysy,"Yeah, it was kinda the point.

:((("
jymhtysy,"I think it was a pretty good reason... the masters are all scared shitless now. Sure, they'll be mad, but still scared shitless."
jymhtysy,"Or he could just, like, you know, cut off contact with Cersei. She's not in the best position to threaten/seduce him at the moment."
jymhtysy,"Off-topic, but King's Landing from this angle makes no sense compared to what we saw recently."
jymhtysy,"Yeah, it kinda would be... to be honest, Ramsey is a pretty expendable character, now that Walda's pregnant."
jymhtysy,It's a little *too* straight-forward. 
jymhtysy,"[AFFC-ADWD](#b ""I'm guessing you don't know that instead of Sansa on the show, the book uses Jeyne Poole, posing as a fake Arya? Jeyne was Sansa's best friend from Winterfell. As Fake Arya, she's abused by Ramsay all the time, and her first bedding involves Theon being forced to go down on her."")"
jymhtysy,"Fear! Right, that's the third noun I was trying to find. 

._.
"
jymhtysy,"I think it's okay. Not terribly exciting, but I'll wait until the season is actually over before saying anything."
jymhtysy,"Seducing Ramsay? I'm sorry, when has she ever learned to do that? And apparently she has to get to Myranda levels of kinky to be remotely interesting to him. No."
jymhtysy,I didn't realize she keeps her dragons between her legs
jymhtysy,"This may be a dumb question, but why do so many houses have Valyrian swords?"
jymhtysy,I'm guessing she either had dye or never touched the hair. Or it just hasn't been that long.
jymhtysy,"Doran will probably just arrest all four of them after their failed attempt at assassinating Myrcella in the Water Gardens. Then.. yeah, that's it. After that, we'll probably just see scenes with Myrcella and (Quentyn? I forgot which one this is). And probably two more scenes with the Sand Snakes/Ellaria in jail.  "
jymhtysy,"We didn't get too much... and I don't care too much for mystery. TV is a very visual medium, so I'd like to see them."
jymhtysy,"Damn, you're right. There are very few Essosi characters that I really care about. Well, Grey Worm and Missandei are nice but their annoying romance is really clouding my judgement.

However, I don't think Slaver's Bay will end up being irrelevant. If Dany gets a happy ending, I think she'll visit the place once in a while to check on things. After all, she's stayed there for a while. And her experience from ruling the place will be valuable later on."
jymhtysy,Banana? I think it's banana.
jymhtysy,"If it's modeled after something, it doesn't have to be the exact same thing. "
jymhtysy,That just sounds so weird in hindsight.
jymhtysy,"She already did that occasionally with Joffrey, though..."
jymhtysy,"Yeah, same here."
jymhtysy,"Also, Visenya's dragon Vhagar grew to the size of Balerion later on, but she eventually died in a fight."
jymhtysy,"Theon would've told Ramsey when he was being tortured. 

&gt;something something flayed man has no secret"
jymhtysy,"We'll see by the end of the season, so I'll reserve any judgement before that. It could very well be a collaborative effort. I'm (hopefully) guessing that Sansa will knife one of the Boltons before she escapes with Theon from Winterfell, or something like that. I know I'm being too optimistic, but I can still try. ;-;"
jymhtysy,"Lol, puberty is a bitch."
jymhtysy,"For me, it's the shape of Westeros. It's kind of a perfect rectangle, and it's painfully obvious that GRRM picked a random sheet of paper and tried to fill it up as much as he could. "
jymhtysy,I certainly don't remember b-list news networks threatening to ditch the show.
jymhtysy,GUESS AGAIN
jymhtysy,Best friends.
jymhtysy,There are lost of similar comments higher up tho.
jymhtysy,Doesn't that permanently damage her fertility though? Or is what Lysa got different?
jymhtysy,"Nobody would've cared if it was Jeyne, either. 
"
jymhtysy,"I'm gonna ask. 

Why is she called kelly c?"
jymhtysy,Psh no he doesn't.
jymhtysy,Oh *shit*. Even Ghis didn't have it that bad.
jymhtysy,There we go. He's just a prostitute.
jymhtysy,"I dunno, I felt like it's just there to make their names distinctive and similar to each other."
jymhtysy,"Oh, I know. "
jymhtysy,"I don't believe that for a second. You can't live with a fabulous tribe of cannibal unicorn island people and *not* become a badass. 

Bran didn't live with unicorn people.
Arya didn't live with unicorn people.
Sansa didn't live with unicorn people.
Robb didn't live with unicorn people.

But Rickon *did* live with unicorn people. Your argument is invalid.

(Is he even living with cannibal unicorn island people in the show?)"
jymhtysy,"Damn. 

I think someone's going to need this:
http://i.imgur.com/7OI1JZS.jpg"
jymhtysy,"Yeah... well, definitely with the darker shade of purple. The picture you provided is far too distracting."
jymhtysy,Wow. So apparently this entire sub agrees that it prefers Joffrey over Tommen *and* Ramsay.
jymhtysy,"Oh my god, yes. Then the next scene happened. 

So like. Yeah. :("
jymhtysy,"Oh. That one is the old one, used by HBO. GRRM officially chose to accept new maps as canon, and OP has one of them."
jymhtysy,"She'll lose all her memories? Wait what?

If you can see a direct sea route from Pyke to Dreadfort that I can't, I'm all ears.

Also, the scene is simply stupid because Ramsay should not be so fookin stupid as to not wear any armor/clothing at ALL. "
jymhtysy,"Well, about that. 

Have you read the books?"
jymhtysy,"I think she recognizes that Cersei is stupid and unpredictable, and arguing with her will not be rewarding or fun."
jymhtysy,Which one?
jymhtysy,But she *is* dumb...
jymhtysy,"Yeah, but Lysa wasn't pretty. 


...

Oh my god, it's possible isn't it."
jymhtysy,ye
jymhtysy,"Is that sarcasm?

As a guy who tried and repeatedly fails to understand clothing, I thought it looked pretty nifty. "
jymhtysy,Right. Loras isn't supposed to be smart.

jymhtysy,"As much as I'd like to see that happen, it would have some terrifying long-term consequences."

jymhtysy,Then why the fuck did she go inside!?!?
jymhtysy,Leave them out of this.
jymhtysy,Exactly.
jymhtysy,"Also, this is kind of important...

LSH isn't even in the show..."
jymhtysy,I didn't downvote you and I've had this iPad for a very long time. 
jymhtysy,Welp. Can't argue with that.
jymhtysy,goddamnit you tag yours too
jymhtysy,"Still, 25. I get that not all characters have a Littlefinger jetpack, but there should definitely be enough time.

Although.. I heard somewhere that HBO is pushing for more seasons, but D&amp;D don't agree. I'm definitely not sure though."
jymhtysy,"I find it slightly amusing that Sansa pretty much forgot about him. Also... [AFFC/ADWD](#b ""someone is supposed to write something and send it to Castle Black, which would end up being very important for a very special scene later on. That will probably be her."")"

jymhtysy,"You're contradicting yourself now. In the post, you made it sound like only Dany could control them. That is not true at all. Now you're admitting that she can't. You know, her Meereen storyline is not completely about her dragons. In fact, it's not at all. GRRM has explicitly stated that he wanted the audience to see the tiring and day-to-day parts of ruling, not just the wars and festivals. 

And people have killed dragons before. It's definitely possible. "

jymhtysy,"Who would eat it though? Nobody else deserves such a fate, and I'm not talking about Ramsay."
jymhtysy,"I'm going to go on the safe side and say that we haven't seen the worst of it yet.

&gt;disappointing

dude."
jymhtysy,"I have a feeling the Sand Snakes are suddenly better because they aren't on the limited schedule that they got in the Water Gardens. Meaning, they can have more retakes and stuff. "
jymhtysy,Friendzoned people are just so relatable tho
jymhtysy,Did he have a reaction?
jymhtysy,"In the show, she seems to be. Apparently not the books, but in the show, yes."
jymhtysy,mhm.
jymhtysy,"Sounds like they're casting the priest, not the gravedigger? Are those the same thing?"
jymhtysy,He probably just doesn't want to outright refuse her order. He can make stuff up about Sansa's situation too.
jymhtysy,"I've come to accept that D&amp;D are not completely stupid, so when an ambiguous decision in the show is not explained, I try not to assume the most obvious choice."
jymhtysy,http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/17/game-thrones-sansa-wedding
jymhtysy,"And him becoming a maester. 

I mean, I didn't want to watch the scene, but it was there for a reason. Just like Ramsay/Sansa's wedding night."
jymhtysy,I don't think he does?
jymhtysy,"I completely agree, I thought Olenna was headed to Lannisport or something (and I was actually excited for that)."
jymhtysy,"O-o
So... [ADWD](#b ""Maybe Hizdahr could be book Quentyn's replacement. As in, getting roasted?"")"
jymhtysy,Aaand then the Hound interrupted it.
jymhtysy,you can say bitch. it's okay.
jymhtysy,"Ay, but they didn't need to torture him like that."
jymhtysy,"Littlefinger... will.. uh... why is he in King's Landing already? 

Anyways, from the trailer, it looks like he'll get arrested by the Sparrows, then he'll get freed by Cersei or something, then Loras goes on trial, and then LF and Cersei have a King's Hand table conversation which we have absolutely never seen before. "
jymhtysy,"Because Jorah was actually supposed to fight, Tyrion wasn't. And they couldn't let Tyrion escape.

All of them have helmets.

He gave them the coin because he has money to throw around, saying that it would be their wage for their entire lives. He just did it to be a dick.

"
jymhtysy,Salsa's family was killed for being stupid. :I
jymhtysy,Something far worse... 
jymhtysy,"Well, um. Well, I agree with you. ^^yay

And OP just deleted the text portion of his post.

Either way, discussing the merits of karmavoting on any internet website is pretty pointless. Let's just enjoy the show, these numbers really shouldn't matter."
jymhtysy,An actress who has a contract that won't let her tits be shown.
jymhtysy,Poor Walda. :(
jymhtysy,okay that's horrifying 
jymhtysy,"Alright, thanks."
jymhtysy,"Yeah, but it still wouldn't make sense.

What I read elsewhere was that bringing Ghost to negotiate peace with sworn enemies is a really stupid thing to do."
jymhtysy,"._. 

It kind of bothers me that 10+ people ask the same question whenever D&amp;D try to be clever."
jymhtysy,HA
jymhtysy,*sharpens pitchfork*
jymhtysy,There are some white people in Mereen...
jymhtysy,How many people pirate the show again? I'm not really sure what 18 million is supposed to mean.
jymhtysy,Damn. That's a lot of reasons.
jymhtysy,There we go. I was thinking the same thing. I'm pretty sure Tommen's actor is only 17 at this point.
jymhtysy,"In the show, he is."
jymhtysy,"What is she trying to do, anyways?"
jymhtysy,"... She also lost the black outfit.

"
jymhtysy,"Bah. Good enough, I guess. 

I know this is completely ridiculous, but I really want to see Sansa become proficient with using/throwing small knives. I don't know why, but I just want to see it happen. "
jymhtysy,It's really pretty though.
jymhtysy,I missed this? When did this happen?
jymhtysy,What the fuck.
jymhtysy,"I still have a hunch that Westeros and Essos are connected further east and north. Like, the Lands of Always Winter are connected to Essos's eastern side, which we don't get to see the full extent of on the maps."
jymhtysy,"Oh right, I have a question.

Why did Cat take Tyrion to Lysa? Couldn't she, like, return to Winterfell or something?"
jymhtysy,"you're right, please tag your post the mods are always watching"
jymhtysy,Right back at ya.
jymhtysy,"Yeah, no. Ramsay knows what the purpose of sex is."
jymhtysy,That makes so much more sense than anything I've read so far.
jymhtysy,"I found that scene strange, too. I think the director focused on it for a few seconds too long."
jymhtysy,"Yeah, you kinda were."
jymhtysy,"Yeah, no offense to anyone, but he did say ""handsome"". and ""man"". Robin's not really there yet."
jymhtysy,"&gt; giant red herring

Yeah, I hope."
jymhtysy,"Well, I know about the theory, including which character is involved, but not the exact details. Haven't read the books, used the wiki."
jymhtysy,"Uh....

UHHHHH..........

Myrcella? I can't think of any male relatives to the Baratheon family other than Stannis.
What about the other Lannisters? Are they allowed to claim birthright?"
jymhtysy,Don't get it.
jymhtysy,"ice dragon hype
"
jymhtysy,"I'm pretty sure Ramsay's off to the battlefield next episode, and she'll be free to fuck up the Boltons as much as she'd like.

Or she would be accompanying them to fight Stannis. 

Or something. She has to do something."
jymhtysy,"I like the Winterfell theme, not sure if it's also called the Stark theme."
jymhtysy,"Elia? 

You mean Ellaria, right?"
jymhtysy,but he was about to get roasted
jymhtysy,"Of course I don't mean that he's telling the truth to *Cersei*, but *we* can see what he's doing."
jymhtysy,:( Is that source completely canon?
jymhtysy,"Yeah.. that would be pretty interesting. The problem here is, comparing to the FMAs might not work, since they deviated at 1/6 of the plot, not at 5/7."
jymhtysy,"Right. Dorne's drama pretty much only affects itself, while the Greyjoy uncles are causing a shitstorm of chaos, even in Meereen. "
jymhtysy,"The fact that she's now some sort of undead skinless spirit looking for revenge is a gigantic trope. She's evil now? That's not character development, that's just a sudden, terribly steep change in personality. Yes, I'd really like to see Cat alive again, but does she really make a difference except kill random Freys and the occasional Podrick or Brienne? She serves no greater purpose, and is a stereotypical zombie overlord. Stoneheart has no redeeming qualities other than being Catelyn Stark when still alive. Overall, boring character. We can just keep hesitantly cheering until she kills enough people so that everyone hates her and she still has no effect on the main story. 

&gt;Sometimes I feel like people who say stuff like ""..



You can talk directly to me. "
jymhtysy,.... It happened in the books. Can you read?
jymhtysy,But the Reach people still believe in the Seven.
jymhtysy,I honestly don't think he cared.
jymhtysy,"&gt; worst father in westeros

see: roose

or balon

orrr robert"
jymhtysy,"Not necessary? I myself was beginning to forget how terrible Ramsay is. How are they supposed to get married without consummating later. It's not something to gloss over, especially since this is Ramsay we're talking about. What else is supposed to happen? Seriously, think of something else that might've gone down successfully in Winterfell during the wedding, which at the same time gives Theon and Sansa's characters proper payoff. You know, if it was actually Jeyne Poole in this scene, I doubt anyone would've cared as much and would be focusing on how shitty the Sand Snakes are. There are plenty more reasons than ""shock value"" (production costs, casting, REASONABLE STORY PROGRESSION, making us remember why we hate Boltons, etc.) and it wasn't as bad as the source material. Jaime&gt;Cersei scene was universally frowned upon since it never existed in the books. Just because none of us wanted to see this happen doesn't mean it automatically stops making sense. "
jymhtysy,D:&lt;
jymhtysy,"Well, he's not exactly supposed to be anything related to ""attractive"" in the books. "
jymhtysy,"Nobody batted an eye on the first thread? What?? Keep scrolling down the comments, there are tons of dissenters. "
jymhtysy,"yayyyyy

flayed skin confetti for effort"
jymhtysy,"Well, there's Tyene with her shrieking when Bronn says ""u fite gud 4 girl"".

Nym, don't fuck this up."
jymhtysy,"oh my god this scene is completely different for me now

"
jymhtysy,"Apparently he fantasized about marrying Sansa, so no, not like a sister. 

*looks at Yara* oh wait."
jymhtysy,I love how nobody even cares about the Sand Snakes right now.
jymhtysy,"Certainly. Tywin must always have badass dark grey armor, and Cersei always. Wears. The. Same. Fucking. Red. Dress. Or any other dress that has floral patterns. Usually red. Oh, and you can smell Joffrey's bitchiness from three miles away. "
jymhtysy,"Her parent's bed probably burned down, though... I hope...

And it isn't. Rose would be sleeping in that one, not Ramsay."
jymhtysy,"Are they seriously doing that?

Which ones?"
jymhtysy,"Somehow, I felt like delaying her appearance made the impact of the RW a bit more real. "
jymhtysy,Right.
jymhtysy,":I 

Welp. Your loss."
jymhtysy,"We weren't completely frustrated with Dany's character development yet, though.
"
jymhtysy,"Well, you sound displeased."
jymhtysy,"Because it was cheap and dampened the effects of the Red Wedding. Also, D&amp;D don't feel like hiring more actors. Or finding new sets. "
jymhtysy," No, they are pretty uncontrollable. They haven't burnt up Meereen yet only because they are chained up. Her soldiers are apparently not too strong either. Oh, and Barristan is dead, Jorah has just returned with Greyscale, Gray Worm is in bed with major injuries and making out with Missandei, and Daario? You're left with one bodyguard who follows her because he thinks she's hot. She does have a pretty boring storyline, but not for the reasons you stated. She's not overpowered at all. "
jymhtysy,"YES. In addition to being happy that these story lines are getting introduced (I have a feeling they'll make Euron's storyline have an influence on Sam's), I just love seeing new locations. "
jymhtysy,"This is fucking Salsa Stark, he can't just do whatever he wants, especially with his father watching."
jymhtysy,"Okay, what the fuck else is Sansa supposed to do? Act like Myranda during sex? I don't think she can do that yet."
jymhtysy,"Oh


okay"
jymhtysy,"Same here. The area around the city is not that mountainous. And it looks so tiny from that angle.

They were probably directly imposing a shot of Dubrovnik and CGI'd it a tiny bit to add the two main landmarks."
jymhtysy,"O-o

""Nobody panicked at Oberyn's death?"" Are you okay?
"
jymhtysy,They should've made the shot of Ramsay's room stretch a little higher to see an intact roof. That probably could've cleared a lot up.
jymhtysy,"You saw Trystane wearing pink, too. "
jymhtysy,"Which five queens? I can recall Cersei, Margaery, Dany, Sansa, and Myrce-

oh...
Okay. Nevermind then. I'll leave this here if anyone else is confused, though."
jymhtysy,"wait what

how old is robert?"
jymhtysy,"No, offc they're not going to let Myrcella go back with Jaime."
jymhtysy,"Would've been hilarious, but I don't think she really knows how to write legibly."
jymhtysy,"what

show or books or both?"
jymhtysy,I can't imagine any of those three delivering the lines in the same amount of time without sounding horribly awkward.
jymhtysy,"""Your father betrayed my father"" well it would be really quick all Tyrion needs to talk about is killing Tywin over a toilet."
jymhtysy,Brienne of Tarth.
jymhtysy,"Yes, I meant cliche.

I don't expect to ever see ADOS, and I don't know if her character will ever get payoff. But I do know that she's pretty boring and one-dimensional right now, and that shows no signs of changing. Like, none. She's, like you said, not at all like her former self, and I don't think that's necessarily a good thing. And if she could show any emotion, that would really be nice. ""shes zombie"" doesn't cut it for me.

And I literally said right after that: her only redeeming quality is previously being Catelyn Stark. "
jymhtysy,"They weren't necessarily untrained rich men with daggers. More likely, they were unemployed pit fighters."
jymhtysy,"Tyrion's definitely getting to Meereen, from what we've seen in trailers."
jymhtysy,"D: Is that why she couldn't have offspring anymore? Well, properly functioning offspring?"
jymhtysy,"Oh right, I remember Jaime's dyslexia now. But didn't Tywin pretty much force it out of him?"
jymhtysy,I don't think that would require anyone to see anyone else's upper thigh.
jymhtysy,Yeah. I think you're onto something.
jymhtysy,"I forgot the rest, but one part of her name is ""Tiger"".,.,.,.,.

what"
jymhtysy,Does he really do that or is it just one of his claims? 
jymhtysy,"Yep, he was interrupted during sexy time with Myranda. Still, he doesn't need to fight *shirtless*... he's lucky he survived, really."
jymhtysy,You're completely right. Bringing racism into this is stretching it too much.
jymhtysy,That's the point.
jymhtysy,it is known
jymhtysy,"Seriously, if an aqueduct is that big... and there were huge mountains in the background, coated with buildings. Hnnggggghhh"
jymhtysy,What does Salsa have against the books? D:
jymhtysy,"o-o

Right.

Robert/Stannis both look like they're in their 50's on the show, while Renly is 23. "
jymhtysy,"Not really love, just really deep ""respect"" and admiration. "
jymhtysy,I'm guessing she either isn't paying attention to her ravens or no one is sending her any.
jymhtysy,"Regardless, we'll see next episode, since Littlefinger appears to have a lot of scenes."
jymhtysy,"I... don't remember her sewing anything white so far? 

I...

That's really sad. "
jymhtysy,rip 2k15-2k15 
jymhtysy,I don't get it
jymhtysy,"She's an idiotic bitch, and everyone else realizes that.

Well, not Tommen. I guess. Huh. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
"
jymhtysy,"No... Myrcella's supposed to be really nice, from what we've seen so far. "
jymhtysy,:(
jymhtysy,"&gt;not being naked on tv makes you a bad person

okay"
jymhtysy,"Okay, let's see. From what I read, Mereen is twice the size of Astapor. Braavos and Volantis are pretty much tied for first, though Braavos is now more powerful. Apparently Pentos and Lys are larger than Astapor. Like, quite a bit larger. And they should not be far behind Braavos/Volantis. So I'm going to place Mereen a bit behind Braavos and Volantis."
jymhtysy,"Well, no shit. The Boltons know that too."
jymhtysy,"Ye, that's what I thought. But I generalized to the Valyrians in general because the Targs weren't very special before the Doom."
jymhtysy,"It's fairly obvious that the makeup/costume departments are simply trying their best to make Sansa look like Catelyn, there's not much else to it.  "
jymhtysy,You're right.
jymhtysy,How do these ratings work? I find it hard to believe that more than half of the reviewers didn't like Seasons 1&amp;2.
jymhtysy,"The link definitely did help. I thought it was that months would be based around years, not the other way around, though? And that if they were based on years, then the cycle of the moon would be irrelevant. Someone else said that tracking the sun's position over a year with a sundial was an option, and I think that's it."
jymhtysy,"[AFFC-ADWD](#b ""Sansa's childhood friend, who gets passed off as a fake Arya and is therefore married to Ramsay. She pretty much gets beaten and forced to partake in bestiality, in addition to the rape we see happening to Sansa."") "

jymhtysy,"Apparently, Sophie Turner was *interested* in the scene.. so um.. yeah, that makes me feel a bit better. Not so much. "

jymhtysy,"Right, but her intended Targaryen husband squired at Highgarden during childhood.

Did I find that out from the wiki or from here? I can't remember."

kjhatch,"If you want to try to account for that dip that based on the leaks, you could gather piracy statistics, and try to come up with a comparative analysis.  Some data on the record-breaking download counts for the leaked episodes is in [this article](http://torrentfreak.com/game-of-thrones-piracy-surges-to-new-high-150422/), and here are some regular download numbers from [2014](http://torrentfreak.com/game-thrones-season-finale-sets-piracy-record-140616/) and [2013](http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-pirated-tv-shows-of-the-season-130622/).  There have been a lot of articles like that mentioning numbers. You could create a chart like your link showing the trend of downloads to extrapolate how many expected piracy downloads there should have been for Season 5.  Subtract that from the leak numbers, and then you can compare the difference to the drop in viewership to whatever increase was caused by the leaks to see if there's any similarity in numbers.  Might not end up being relevant, but it would probably still be interesting."
kjhatch,"The woodswitch (Maggy the Frog) is with the Old Gods.  Quaithe is from Asshai like Melisandre, and as both are shadowbinders, Quaithe's magic is probably linked to R'hllor too. Mirri Maz Duur is a priestess of the Lhazareen's Great Shepherd. The Warlocks' eastern magics are more unexplained so far in the story, but they seem related to alchemy. 

It's notable that some backstory in the books states the Warlocks' magic was all but gone until recent events (the comet and dragons' birth) that ""brought magic back into the world.""  There are magic items in the books mentioned as suddenly working again after being dormant for years.   It seems like there may be magics from gods and magics from learning/alchemy, with the latter far less effective or consistent."
kjhatch,You need to read [the posting rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/posting_policy).
kjhatch,thanks for the kind words :)
kjhatch,"&gt; it's still interesting to see.

Technically not here anymore though.  Linking to IMDB or posting screenshots of it has been outside this sub's scope for a couple years now.  There have been lots of fake edit trolling and even more non-relevant ""look what other movie X actor was in"" posts.  It's like linking to Google or Wikipedia, where the post becomes more about the site content and not GOT or ASOIAF. "
kjhatch,"&gt; I figured that the big bold paragraph would be the first thing anyone sees when they come to the post. 

That still breaks the sub's rules on spoiler warnings, and people still got spoiled by seeing the wrong warning.  The rules we have i place here are designed to provide as much safety as is realistically possible in an online setting like this.  And they have been pretty well tested now over the last four years, so we have a good idea what works consistently.  

&gt; Aren't mods able to change titles, though?

Reddit does not allow titles, thumbs, or links to be changed once a post is submitted.  The only way to alter any of them is to make a new post.  Mods' powers are similarly limited to the subreddits they moderate.  We can't change a user's post, only what appears in the subreddit.  A post removed from a sub is still in the user's history; it's just hidden from the rest of the public browsing the sub.  So even if titles could be edited, that'd be a user ability and not for mods to do either.  We don't moderate accounts at all, just the scope of subreddits."
kjhatch,"Because if the books end with everyone truly just dying, the bad guys win, that's it and too bad, most fans will hate it.  GRRM's writing more realistic fiction, but it's still fiction.  He's always written stories for people to be entertained.   He said the ending will be *bittersweet* not bitter.  There will be some good in it, and even if not everyone is happy about it, the story ending will be satisfying.  "
kjhatch,because TV
kjhatch,"&gt;  untrained Unsullied 

Yeah I've read that argument a lot.  The problem with it is that it's been months since Dany freed them.  It's unrealistic that a group of fighters proud of their ""best in the world"" identity would just never train again, especially when they're still working as soldiers.  Anyone needing extra training would have received it in those months.  

Then for the sake of argument, pretend there's still a block of Unsullied who are terrible fighters and can barely hold their spears.  It's also terribly unrealistic for all of them to be patrolling the city together.  At the very least they would be split up so only one untrained person would work with others for both safety and training.  That group was also led by Grey Worm, who it's safe to assume would have ""some"" idea how to set up a safe and effective patrol group.

The only thing that makes sense is bad writing."
kjhatch,"&gt; frustrating seeing how entitled some TV fans like to act. 

Yeah, it's a problem for some book fans too.  We want the subreddit to be as inclusive as possible, but there will always be selfish people wanting only their view.

&gt; yet this doesn't upset us.

You don't see all the complaints.  Getting that theory spoiled has upset many people.  That specific theory is why green theory tags were added to this subreddit originally.  The major book theories, including that one, are essentially future spoilers.  Even if they're not 100% true, it's obvious some things are right.  Some readers don't want to know theories; they just want to talk about about the books they've read as-is.  That's more common with recent readers, but in fairness it really doesn't matter.  Everyone ought to be able to discuss without spoiler danger.

&gt; it is not a spoiler because it is not verified; it is just plain old speculation.

See that's dangerous here.  As I said speculation is a spoiler here.  Granted that's not the case in other communities, but ""plain old speculation"" requires spoiler warnings just like canon events.

&gt; Please tell me you will be applying the same iron rule for spoilers/speculation next season when the show starts to overtake the books? 

The spoiler system here already covers that.  It really doesn't matter if the show provides book-story spoilers first or if the show goes off and finishes the story to be completely different than the books.  Show and book spoiler warnings are mutually exclusive.  Sharing the same event is a coincidence that's irrelevant in the eyes of a spoiler tag.  The system was designed to handle anything, and it still works fine for where the show's going now.

&gt; I fear a rather large exodus of subscribers if they are allowed free rein just because something has aired when it will still be a huge spoiler for book readers who've had to hold their tongues for the last 5 years.

People still can't mention Ned's death without warning.  Granted there are a lot of people posting spoilers without warning in general lately, and we're about to post a mod reminder about that, but all spoilers from the whole story are still moderated.  It doesn't matter what the show does."
kjhatch,"Winterfell is just the main castle for the nobles, their support staff, any soldiers, etc.   In the lands around the castle are the smallfolk who farm the area, have shops, and provide the goods that support Winterfell.  They're likely staying at an inn in the town outside the walls."
kjhatch,"The moondoor in the floor was cool.  Arya with Tywin in Harrenhal was better.  The Red Wedding in the show was more dramatic with Talisa there.  I also didn't miss Sam's extended boat travel or the stay in Braavos.  I assume they'll make a ""quick trip"" south on the Kings road using Littlefinger's speedy service to make up for the time.

The combined Sansa/Theon/Brienne plots seem to be an improvement so far too.  I don't miss the Mance/Spearwives that were ridiculous by the end of the escape.  Sansa in place of Jeyne is already greatly improving the impact of the Winterfell events.  And Brienne really is better and more consistent being in place up North than the Riverlands/Jaime plots that seem a lot less relevant now with Jaime down in Dorne.

EDIT: Oh I also did not miss Tyrion's LONG boat ride through Essos. Putting him with Varys and not spending months on the travel time is better.  I do hope they are intending to bring Aegon back in some other way [like this theory](#g ""He'll be Trystane instead""), but so far it's an improvement."
kjhatch,"Yep, your tag is perfect.  Thanks for working on it.  I'm afraid I do need to ask you to alter the warning label a bit though.  The standing, ""known"" information about Jon is that he's Ned's son and his mother is unknown.  Everything else is in the theory.  Naming it for warning labels is general done as some variation of ""Jon's mother theory"" or ""Jon's parents theory"" or ""Jon's lineage theory"" etc.

[Jon's parents theory](#g ""That way you're not contradicting the 'Ned is his father' information.  Saying he's not a bastard doesn't make sense unless Ned's not the father, and that expresses part of the theory outside the warning."")"

There haven't been that many of them on the show.  Yes, some viewers have figured it out on their own, just as some readers figured it out on their own while *most readers who know about it now only learned about the Jon theories online*.

kjhatch,"GRRM doesn't do Reddit, and he also hates fanfic set in his worlds, so between the two of those we can't link to that."

""The Future Queen"" is vague speculation that can fit any of the possible ""queen"" roles people have associated with her, including the possibility of being Queen on the Iron Throne.

kjhatch,"[Theory about Aegon in the Show](#g ""Aegon is Doran's nephew.  He'd want him protected as much as any Targ/Blackfyre. Aegon spends most of ADWD getting to the Stormlands.  It'd be MUCH simpler to have him revealed in Dorne from the start, and as a character who already has a reason to exist in the world.  It also means not needing all of Doran's other years-long plots to get back the Throne that have also been cut from the show, because he's got Aegon right there.  It's easier to protect and hide a Targaryen in a secure location like that than traveling all around Essos, and it's easier to give him that ""King's education"" that'll theoretically be important later."")  As far as the show goes with how it's dropped many of the book plots, that would make a lot more sense if they are going to include Aegon.

There have been many changes to simplify the story, and not all have been good, but some of the show changes were actual improvements (that GRRM's said he liked too).

* ""hey this real world things reminds me of GOT"" - those should be posted to /r/earthoficeandfire instead
* a direct reference to modern religion - always immediately pulled

and any one of those qualifies as outside the sub's scope.  The modern religion is the simplest to explain, which is why I stopped with it earlier.

And now Littlefinger is back in town suddenly at the same time Olyvar becomes a star witness?  There's at least the suggestion of more happening behind the scenes with Littlefinger's involvement to escalate the conflict between Cersei and the Tyrells.

"
kjhatch,"&gt; what was the point of TV Cersei making the High Sparrow High Septon? ...she re-establishes the Faith Militant, and why?

She thinks the High Sparrow can be controlled/bought, or at the very least that he might feel loyalty to her for the support she gives.  She wants him in the position so that he can be a weapon she can use against others.  Most everyone is corrupt in some way or another, and with a righteous order bent on cleaning up the town, Cersei can point them at her targets.  And then when they do her dirty work, she's absolved of blame because she doesn't directly control the church.

&gt;  Because she wanted an excuse to imprison Ser Loras for being gay, on account of she doesn't like the Tyrells... Couldn't she have found an easier way to do that?

That's more about the show simplifying the book's plot.  In the book remember Loras is sent off to take Dragonstone, and he's reportedly injured/maimed as a result.  His story arc there is now combined with the Faith Militant, and I assume they will severely injure him in some similar fashion so that the end result is the same.

&gt;  On this week's episode she sends King Tommen, her last living son, to confront the high Septon armed with nothing more than a few Kingsguard against a LITERAL army of people who could easily murder him with no repercussions whatsoever.

She doesn't see the danger, just as she has no idea they can come for her too. She's blinded by her belief that she can ""play the game"" as well as Tywin, and she can't.  
"
kjhatch,That's outside the scope.  Try /r/earthoficeandfire for that.
kjhatch,"It actually deals with the witch at the beginning of S5, known as Maggy the Frog in AFFC.   In the books she states:

&gt; Cersei: Will the king and I have children?
&gt; Maggy: Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you. 

Valonqar is High Valyrian for ""little brother,"" which is why Cersei feels so threatened by Tyrion.  But there's a prevailing [theory about what the prophecy means (heavy speculation for end of story)](#g ""that Jaime is the little brother, and he'll be the one who kills Cersei. Losing his hand is another way GRRM is trying to throw off Readers about him being the one.  Some people feel he'll end up hating her, but personally I think it'll be a mercy killing.  By that point in the story Cersei will have literally lost everything but Jaime, and she'll hate him for it all anyway.  She'll likely be broken if not crazy. So he'll strangle her, perhaps even at her request, to put her out of her misery."") And that's why I doubt Jaime will die any time soon.  

[Jaime end-story heavy speculation, some Kingsguard info](#g ""I also think Jaime's going to outright survive to lead the Kingsguard.  It's his arc to finally become a selfless, honorable knight, and he's got to serve on the KG to accomplish that redemption.  He's also the only one suitable to transition and really lead the next crop of KG for the Kind/Queen on the throne at the end.  I think the time with LSH will set him on that path.

kjhatch,"The War of the Five Kings did more damage to the Riverlands and Westerlands than all the wildlings could do in years of running around free.  For the sake of argument, assume the wildling army was truly 50K strong and the wall didn't exist, so they were all able to just move on through.  They don't have horses, most have little training, and they're traveling with wives and children, their old and their sick, without support from anywhere. There are no supply lines feeding their army as it moves.  Even striping every town they come across will still mean starvation if they don't break up and look for food and shelter separately.  And one they break into more manageable bands, the local garrisons can take care of them.  Ygritte was in awe at seeing the run-down holdfast structures south of The Wall; the wildings have no idea what a real keep or castle looks like, let alone how to attack one.  Sure they'll be hunting game in the woods and travel on roads would become more dangerous for a time, but they won't destroy any serious infrastructure, and over time they'll either have to assimilate or be killed.  

In contrast, by the time Robb made it through the Twins and started clashing with the Lannisters he had 24K troops.  The comments on the Lannisters Riverlands battles and Edmure's efforts to raise troops shows the Riverlands were fielding at least another 15K aroudn that time.  Tywin started gathering troops much earlier, which was why his army was larger.  References in the books put it at 35K; the show upped it to nearly 60K.  So that whole region has already been demolished by armies twice the size of all those wildlings.  They've already eaten through towns' supplies, killed plenty of locals, and burned crops to prevent resources falling into enemy hands.  And that's just the troops fighting in the Riverlands.  The Reach, Stannis, and Ironborn all had their fights as well.  The whole point of the title ""A Feast for Crows"" is all the ""vultures"" benefiting from the post-wars devastation.  

Read through [this thread](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/66106-house-army-numbers/) for examples of the hundreds of thousands of troops the rest of Westeros could potentially muster, and remember how many do have training, real weapons, and armor, let alone the local support.  The Red Wedding took Noble leadership from the North, crippling their ability to hold together a large army, but once they lost, thousands of troops made their way back to their homes.  Those thousands of experienced soldiers are the ones defending their people when any wildling groups attack.

&gt; hordes of wildling raiders would've been pillaging the whole of westeros.

That's the real myth.  They're rabble with too few numbers to ever cause real damage.  The Reach alone could easily take them with their numbers.  Dorne's and the Eyrie's armies are also both untouched.  Even if they made it to the Neck, they'd start to encounter foreign environment problems with flora they don't recognize.  Here's another [good old discussion](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/110802-the-true-power-of-the-wildlings/) on this topic.  

The difference with the White Walkers is they they don't need food, water, or rest.  They are an actual army with leadership, not just a collection of individuals sticking together only while it suits them.  Every person killed by a White Walker army adds to their forces, and they fear nothing.  That is a real threat to all of Westeros. That's the only danger to be concerned about for the rest of the story."

* Something related to the show or books should exist in the image/article/etc. prior to the post, and that connection should be the focus/point.
* Posts about non-related subjects that have only a casual connection are not relevant to story discussion

Your post was primarily about the actors doing other jobs.  Yes, the writer tried very hard to make as many GOT references as possible, but the other jobs are not really about GOT.  Most of those have also already attempted to be posted here, especially the Kristofer Hivju vids.  The clarifications section also links to the [What Not To Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/dont_post) list of even more specific examples of things that people have tried to post when they don't read the rules, and that list includes:

* Joffrey was in Batman, or any other actor's past roles
* Charles Dance Dancing, or any other actor's past roles
* Robert's Early Days when Mark Addy was in A Knight's Tale, or any other actor's past roles
* Robert's Early Days when Mark Addy was in Flintstones, or any other actor's past roles

The list is out of date now as there are at least another half dozen newer commercials, films, and songs that are getting regularly reposted in recent months. But none of that is about the show or books; it's about the actors.  The ""almost never relevant"" is because on very rare occasions someone posts something that ties back to some other role or job but also very directly relates to the show.  The casting comparison photos are like that.  

"
kjhatch,"Well, the North, maybe.  It's doubtful the wildlings would head south and take over all of Westeros.  Until it's known exactly what the White Walkers are going to do there's also no way to know even how important The Wall really is to ""saving the realm.""  Maybe they just want to sit down and have some tea."

kjhatch,"GRRM is a mature writer with a lifetime of experience writing for both publication and TV.  ASOIAF is a groundbreaking work with a modern, gritty realism that's gotten GRRM labeled the ""American Tolkien.""  ASOIAF has greatly influenced Fantasy over the last decade with many writers adopting models employed in the books.

Paolini is a very young writer who was able to get Eragon published by a combination of extreme persistence and pure luck.  As a teenage writer he's marketable as more unique, and as a person he's a likable guy who does well with personal appearances.  That combined with his ability to actually finish books got his series published, but that doesn't make Inheritance a quality piece of work.  It's very derivative (some have called it plagiarism), and the characters and story are not really developed past the established references he pulled from. 

There's honestly no fair comparison to make between the series.  ASOIAF is a quality piece of work, and even so it took years before it became famous+mainstreamed.  Paolini was just lucky, and hopefully he'll keep at it and produce much better works in a few years.  "

kjhatch,"&gt; you could not see what the spoiler said for the green/red spoiler lines while you could see the black ones

That may be just an issue with legacy tags.  Some people still type spoiler tags with / rather than #, and it does not work well for touch screens.  If the tags you just happen to be testing are the / tags, they're not going to work as effectively on some readers.

Check the [mod post I mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/35obg5/mod_raven_a_reminder_of_the_rules_episode/) to see if the tag in the theory section works for you.  It's a standard green theory tag using #.  Those tags read normally on my Baconreader on Android. 

This subreddit still works with / tags for legacy support.  If you search the posts and want to read something from years back, it's good to maintain those old tags to still hide the spoilers.  But that allows some people to still use them today, resulting in tags that are not 100% consistent.  

&gt; when you click the link it redirects you to reddit.com in the in-app browser

That specifically sounds like you're trying to read a / spoiler tag and not a # one.   Redirecting you to the root home is technically what you should get when following a / href.  The same thing tends to happen with phone or tablet browser apps.  

The old ""tricks"" to get the / spoiler tag to still work on mobile was to either do a press-swipe motion, so it'll reveal on press, but the swipe would stop the load, or do a press, load the wrong/dead page, and then go back to the old page and for some apps the spoiler tag would show as active and visible then.

Have you tried to simply use Safari?  I've tested the sub with desktop Safari extensively, and it should work the same on iPhone too.  I've also used Dolphin, Firefox, and Chrome mobile browsers for Reddit, and I still use Chrome every day with it (it provides mod tools the reader apps don't).  It means zooming in and out a lot, but it's also very functional, especially if you have a bigger screen with a new phone.

kjhatch,The direwolves are often mentioned in the books and play important parts in the story.  The show has reduced their significance greatly. 
kjhatch,"&gt; I thought she wouldn't be back this season.

Case in point, I did expect her to reappear closer to the end of the season.  I don't think the Ironborn have simply been written out of the show, and I expect them to have a stronger showing next season.  Info can be taken to mean lots of things.  We really look for spoiler management with specific events that can be moderated consistently."
kjhatch,You've been banned already.  Reading up on [the subreddit's posting rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/posting_policy) really should have been done before it was lifted.  So this is your last warning.  Keep your posts inside the scope.

kjhatch,"The books have Rickon taken Skagos by Osha.  The inhabitants are reportedly savages, but more likely they're simply very tough Northerners who can protect Rickon.  Shaggydog's wild-dog actions suggest Rickon will fit in fine there.  The show's simplified plot takes Rickon to stay with the Umbers, where watchers will remember the Greatjon as one of the Stark's strongest supporters.  They're also guaranteed to keep him safe.  What that should be for is simply saving Rickon till the very end of the story when he's in a position to reappear and take over leadership of the North as the remaining Stark heir.  The name shaggydog is a joke reference to that fate.  A 'shaggy dog story' is a very long-winded tale filled with a lot of non-relevant events that finally  ends with a disconnected or anticlimactic ending.  Rickon is the punchline to the shaggy dog tale, because he's probably going to be forgotten and left out of the story till the very end.  He's just there to take over Winterfell/The North when no one else is left to provide end-story stability.

"
kjhatch,"Both shows share a few of the same actors (Rose Leslie and Iain Glen come to mind pretty easily), and both deal with the politics and privilege of upperclass nobles and the regular people who serve them.  There have also been quite a few posts on various sites that talk about [how similar the shows are](http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/downton-abbey/game-of-thrones-versus-downton-abbey-are-they-the-same-show/).

kjhatch,You should watch it again and note how the now-old man took out over a dozen of them while multiple were attacking him at once.  He did fine.  It was the Unsullied using war spears in cramped town walkways that fought poorly.  It looked like Grey Worm was the only one of them with real training.
kjhatch,Same issue with this post. It needs a story main tag like [TV] or [S5].  Please read [the subreddit's spoiler guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide).
kjhatch,So you're still not going to read the sub's posting rules?  The point is not this one bad post; it's preventing you from posting outside the scope or with spoilers in the future.
kjhatch,"The other posts in this thread don't dwell on anything completely book-specific.  The final scene in S4 has produced a fair amount of non-reader mild-speculation that includes comments like ""ancient tree guy.""  Your comment was very specific to the books [ADWD and D&amp;E](#b ""with Bloodraven identified and the warg-training reference"") that non-readers won't know anything at all about.
"
kjhatch,"&gt; I'm just not sure why they exist 

The show doesn't use them a lot because it can be hard to work with animals and CGI is expensive.  In the books they're very important both as active characters doing things and as symbolic foreshadowing (like a lot of stuff in the books)

[Heavy speculation explaining the relevance of direwolves in the story](#g ""The direwolves were gifts by the Old Gods to mark/awaken each of the Stark children for the epic troubles that were coming.  Each Stark has a destiny to separately become very exceptional in their pursuits.  They each become the 'best' at what they do, some even doing things that no one has ever done in the world before.  The direwolves' names (and for some their actions) are clues to the Starks' fates."")

For example: [Direwolf foreshadowing for Robb with Grey Wind, spoilers through S3/ASOS](#g ""Grey is the color of death in ASOIAF (many references), and wind is a fleeting thing that blows strong but fades.  Robb was destined to die young regardless of becoming King in the North."")"
kjhatch,"Because recast actors look different.  I [just commented on that](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/37y12o/tv_how_much_time_have_passed_since_events_of_s01e1/crqu5oy) in the timeline post from a few hours ago:

&gt; It's also worth noting that actors' ages in the show often seem to have little relevance to the passage of time or the more realistic timeline in the books.  Many posts have been made about Gilly's baby, the recast Tommen and Myrcella, the apparent age of Sandor in relation to his ""older brother"" Gregor, Tyrion being older than he should be, Dinklage being older than Headly and Coster-Waldau, etc.  Characters made older in the show also sometimes act as young as they are in the books, like Dany and Tommen, which makes sense to keep the books' story going, but it doesn't always make sense for the show-older characters.  The reason for that is it's better to get good actors to play the roles in the show even if the ages/appearances don't always match up perfectly.  "

kjhatch,Please repost this without the title spoiler. 
kjhatch,"I assume you mean in time to bring Jon back?  Since the show went out of the way to note the Lord Commander ordering for Jon, it seems very likely it'll follow the same pattern predicted in the books, where Jon will stay dead for a while, long enough that another Lord Commander will be named (999th) so that when Jon finally does come back he can get selected as the 1,000th Lord Commander.  It also ties in with the whole ""ghost"" foreshadowing with his direwolf's name (like all the kids).

kjhatch,"""Over taken"" doesn't work for most since the show has changed and compressed much of the plots.  The timeline of the show is roughly in the middle of AFFC/ADWD right now, but some characters have been moved forward and others have been delayed.  The popular notion that the show's already passed the books is grossly exaggerated.  Events have been altered, but the show is not even done with ADWD for most characters.  Here's a vague list based on what's happening to them right now compared to events at the end of ADWD:

* Tyrion - is definitely farther along.
* Daenerys - is behind by quite a few events, but most of ADWD will probably happen by the end of S5.
* Jon - is behind, but should catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Arya - is behind, but her scenes are compressed, so she'll probably catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Sansa - is probably farther along.  Her plot has been changed, but the direction is still the same.
* Bran - will finish catching up with ADWD when he returns in S6.
* Jaime - is changed, but based on the plots he's been merged into he'll likely catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Brienne - is also changed, but like Jaime she's working with merged plots and will be caught up by the end of S5.
* Rickon - is already where he needs to be.
* Theon - is behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Stannis - is behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Cersei and the rest of the KL storylines - are behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Sam - is way behind, and clearly they've greatly altered his upcoming plot.  It's unclear where he's going at the moment.
* Yara and the rest of the Ironborn - are way behind but they should all catch up in S6.
* Doran and the Sand Snakes - are a little behind, but they should be caught up to the big points by the end of S5.

Is that clear enough?  If I missed a character you want to know about just ask."

He's been raised in hiding and trained to be a king in order to take back the Crown.  He's the one Tyrion meets on his way to Dany.  There's also a theory that he's a Blackfyre Targaryen who's been told he's Aegon, which honestly makes more sense than real-Aegon suddenly being alive.  I think pairing Sansa and Aegon is a strangly too-good-it-must-be-fiction type of match, given their ages, backgrounds, and the fact one's been setup/trained by Littlefinger and the other Varys.  Having them end up on the throne together makes for a very stable political Crown that would bring a believable peace to Westeros like really nothing else would.  Even Dany and her dragons burning everyone into submission is a short-term peace.  There's no evidence there will ever be other dragons, and the public will not love her like they can Sansa.  Aegon brings all of the Targaryen heritage to the table like Dany, but his education is far more important long-term than the dragons.  He should end up on the Throne.  How the show's going to handle all that I have no idea.  They've simplified a lot of characters down, and if they've changed/merged Aegon we'll hopefully see it this season."")

Timing.  In the books Sam's on his way to Oldtown. In the show he's not even let yet, but next season's casting list suggests Sam will be making the same trip (though I'm guessing by land).  He's not there for Jon's death, and won't be there for the 999th's election.  The point of the Oldtown trip was to make his chain, which is supposed to take years.  Even if Sam just drops Gilly+baby off, runs to Oldtown, and ""omg I found this important thing to take back to the Wall"" back to Castle Black, he's going to miss most of the big events.  The Others should attack by then, and it's very likely the Wall will fail and even more of the Watch will be killed.  I don't see any way Sam's return is going to rally supporters who mostly don't know him to make him LC.  

Plus the direction of the show's plot makes it seem more likely Sam will have to leave before Jon gets back.  If that's the case he may just desert to save Gilly (and himself) from the other Watch.  There are a lot of red flags saying Sam's gone and won't be back.   At best Sam might return in the story's epilogue to become the Maester of the new, rebuilt Watch after all the fighting is done.

&gt; His Watch will have ended.

Not to him.  He's not looking for loopholes.  He's the hero looking to do what's right.  If winning the war means leading the Night's Watch to so it, he'll gladly re-accept leadership to get the job done.  He does not care about the Iron Throne, and he's not being set up to take over Winterfell.  That means his ""destiny"" is most likely the Wall with the Watch.  If he survives the big war he can rebuild the Watch and lead for X years into a period of safe stability.  He might just die anyway in the fighting, making the issue moot.

There are quite a few book details the show has not provided, and actually this episode is the first real attempt of the show to ""catch up"" on some of those details.  

Some of the mods think you might be trolling; i.e. pretending to be a non-reader.  Up until this episode there's really been no way for a non-reader to know anything about this theory.  Even if you're not trolling, your post is filled with book readers who should not be posting in a [Show Only] thread.

He'll have to pay the iron price to achieve everything, and in effect become a living metaphor for the Drowned God's teachings.  He'll rise again, harder and stronger.  He'll take his name back.  He missed the kingsmoot, so he's the only one who can dispute it.  He'll gain supporters by showing he's a true ironborn, and he'll go back to the Iron Islands to kick Euron off the Seastone Chair.  It could be one of the most dramatic, epic, and badass redemption arcs of the whole story.  I've been saying that since ASOS, and so far all of the events through ADWD support that.

&gt; Theories are spoilers too? 

Yes, all major/established theories are spoilers because the majority of them are well supported and likely true.   

Extensive speculation with details about any subject should also carry a theory warning to be safe.  For example mild/idle speculation like ""I think Hodor will win the Iron Throne"" doesn't require a theory warning, but if someone were to lay out their detailed speculation about all the events that lead to Hodor winning the Iron Throne, then that theory would need warning.

kjhatch,"&gt;  Jon is being set up to take over Winterfell

I think the writing on the wall points more to Rickon for that.  He's the ""shaggy dog"" in the story. The only reason for his existence at all in the story is to show up at the end, and the only thing that'd be left for him to do is take over Winterfell as the last surviving Stark (who's not doing something else).  And if Rickon's doing that, then there's nothing left for Jon to do.  I agree if the 1,000th election is held after the battles are all done, there's an opportunity for Sam to be back and get elected by the remnants of the Watch, especially if he somehow distinguishes himself in the battle, but for that to happen Jon would have also died in the battle. 

&gt; Robb already legitimized him. That means he has a stronger claim than any of his siblings.

So did Stannis essentially, and that was a stronger offer.  Jon didn't need Rob's letter to establish that, and since Rob was also an upstart King not acknowledged by the Iron Throne, the only people who would care about Rob's word on that are other Northerners.  Jon's legitimacy would need to be established by the Iron throne to hold for the rest of Westeros.  The importance of Stark legitimacy then seems to relate back to Jon being a rallying point for the final battle. The Northerners who know of Rob's letter will follow Jon as a Stark.

The name shaggydog is a joke reference to that fate.  A 'shaggy dog story' is a very long-winded tale filled with a lot of non-relevant events that finally  ends with a disconnected or anticlimactic ending.

The kingsmoot, uncles, pirating in the Reach, etc. can all just be boiled down to Balon's eventual death and the ironborn being thrown into chaos.  Without all the backstory, there can be anonymous fighting among the stronger ironborn for control, no one wanting to follow Yara, etc.  The show will just follow Theon instead, and he'll arrive back in the Iron Islands strong and ready to clear out the fighting to bring them to order.  That timing makes more sense with delaying the ironborn plot for another season too.

kjhatch,"The show's timeline does not match the books' perfectly, but it's been 2-2.5 years since the beginning of Season 1."
kjhatch,"I've been working with spoiler tagging on Reddit for longer than Alien Blue has existed.  Reddit has never provided CSS support, and all spoiler tagging on Reddit has been about using CSS to fake the tagging effect native to most forum systems. Originally, when subreddit first tried to bring spoiler tags to Reddit, the markup link was altered with CSS in a variety of inconsistent ways.  Different methods worked with varied levels of success on different browsers, and it was mostly a mess.  I was tired of that when I reworked the tagging here back in 2011.  For the first version I pulled examples of tags from every subreddit using them I could find and took the best bits of each as a baseline, and from there tweaked the code till it worked for all browsers.  That style slowly became the most common on Reddit, and when we changed from the / to # to better support mobile users that change also spread.  The way tags are done here *is* the Reddit standard.  I've seen my code copy-pasted in dozens of other subs.  

The original link switch for tags was commonly /s or /spoiler.  /s was shorter and easier, which is why it was used here.  Most subs only needed one tag, but there has always been a need for multiple.  From the very beginning this sub had /s and /b for show and book spoilers.  I know /r/thewalkingdead and /r/lost were both prominent back then with multiple tags too.  Not all subs used /s even then, but all tags started with a ""/"" for the link, and most put the spoiler in the title attribute.  

So when Alien Blue comes along and only supports ""/s,"" they got it wrong from the beginning.  I personally tried to document the variants and explain the need to support what already exists on Reddit in multiple subs.  It was a while after the change to # for touch screens that Alien Blue added ""#s"" support.  **All Alien Blue has to do is tag by ""/"" and ""#"" not ""/s"" and ""#s"" to add support.**  It's that simple, and they won't do it.  

&gt; You would have to go through each sub's custom commands and write the code into the app to work like other spoilers, which is too hard or time consuming for all of them it seems.

That's their argument, which is a weak lie.  I've worked as an application programmer for well over a decade, and most of the time it was working with other programmers' old code that needed updating.  The only way it's ""too hard"" is if their code is a complete mess.  

&gt; There are 2 spoiler commands that work site wide, that a couple of the apps use, that appear as the black bar spoilers like in this post. The green/red bars that this sub uses are specific to this sub only, are therefore don't work on any app that I have tried so far.

Multiple spoiler tag use is common on Reddit.  Just for a very easy example, go to the list of subs on /r/television and visit them all.  Notice how many use multiple tags, and how some don't even use ""s"" for any of them.  I don't see why you're saying that when it's blatantly not true.

What apps have you tried then?  Baconreader, Reddit is Fun, and Reddit Sync are by far the most recommended every time I see someone ask for suggestions.  They all work fine.   Reddit Sync makes all spoiler tags variants blue.  Baconreader and Reddit is Fun both make them all black.  Just to be 100% sure they still have support, I checked current versions of all three just now with the Mod message stickied to the top of this sub.  It has both show and theory spoilers tagged in the OP text, and the different spoiler tags worked in all three of those apps.  

"
kjhatch,"[TV][No Spoilers] together is a mismatched warning.  One means spoilers and the other means no spoilers.  They should not be used together.  If you're unclear on the way main tags work, please review the [spoiler guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide).

kjhatch,"[Direwolf foreshadowing for Jon and Ghost WARNING HEAVY SPECULATION](#g ""So Jon is killed at the end of ADWD.  He'll warg into Ghost and stay there for a while, essentially becoming a ghost himself, haunting Castle Black without being able to speak, etc.  That time in Ghost seems certain because he was elected the 998th LC of the Night's Watch.  That's an awfully specific number.  I don't see any reason how it can mean anything but that while Jon is a ghost for a while, weeks or even months, some other LC will be elected.  After that everything falls apart as the White Walkers attack and kill lots of people including the LC.  Somehow after that (I assume Mel will be involved too) Jon will come back to life (reborn as Azor Ahai, the Lightbringer, etc.).  By then everyone will understand Jon was right about the wildlings and getting any help they can and/or the whole AA thing will make it obvious they should listen to him.  So just in time Jon is re-elected as the 1,000th LC to lead the Night's Watch in the final battle against the Others."")

And then there's this other half:

[Direwolf foreshadowing for Jon and Ghost WARNING HEAVY SPECULATION](#g ""So Jon is actually the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, making Jon half Targaryen (fire) and half Stark (ice).  He's the true heir to the Iron Throne, but more importantly he's the Prince That Was Promised, and the Song of Ice and Fire is about him.  It's also why he is reborn as Azor Ahai to become the savior of mankind.  Somewhat by definition at this point in the story, all the other Targaryens are assumed to be dead, so Jon is a 'ghost' for that reason too.  If anyone knew who he was he'd have been killed as a baby.  The direwolf name is hinting as his 'undead' lineage."")"

kutwijf,"Oh, I just remembered.. I don't care."
kutwijf,"To be fair, those masters were probably all guilty of conspiring against her. She was already attacked, so it was retaliation/fear tactics. Stannis allowed people to be burned alive because of their faith. "

Also, Sansa wasn't raped. "
kutwijf,"Cool dude. I haven't seen the Wire yet, but thx for the spoiler."
kutwijf,Brienne
kutwijf,"You do have a point. Though the main reason they ""sold"" him was because Thoros is a believer of R'hllor. The Red Priestess said that Gendry was important and she needed him. I don't know if the money would have done it solely. I can't remember if it was explained to him why they gave him up. 

I mean another reason he might go to them is to find Arya."
kutwijf,"I don't think she ever told the Brotherhood that she needed him for sacrifice. 

And anyways, she could keep using leeches, I mean they worked right? I'm not sure his blood is strong enough for her to make a shadow baby, but if so, one more reason not to kill him.

Well he told him ""when you reach Kings Landing.."", because he sent him off in that direction. Did he tell or insinuate to him that he should hide from the Brotherhood? I don't remember. "
kutwijf,"Well, there's certainly worse people out there.

kutwijf,I agree.
kutwijf,"I don't mind how he died, only that it was too soon. I can get over it because it's for a good reason (plus it was an epic death - not fighting for glory etc, but to save someone) but it's a shame D&amp;D couldn't find another way. "
kutwijf,White knight material
kutwijf,"He was worging into a raven or crow.

No, I don't know. I assume a prayer or farewell to his family."

kutwijf,"We were talking Valyrian steel. I wasn't talking medieval times. 

Quality comes first, of course, but I do think that weight played a part. A lighter blade can mean more speed, effecting striking and parrying. Size of course, effecting mobility as well. Length can be nice for reach, but not as effective in close quarters.

If we're talking equal quality material and craftsmanship, I would go with a poleaxe or spear. Otherwise I'd go with a rapier and ring guard parry dagger.

"
kutwijf,Well that and Talisa. Then Edmure. But it all started with Catelyn taking Tyrion before contacting Ned. 
kutwijf,"I've heard people calling it a ""brutal rape"", and apparently people have quit watching the show over it. My question is: Was she actually even raped on her wedding night? I mean didn't she consent to it? Wasn't it all apart of her plan? She was never going to ""want"" to have sex with him, but she was still willing to, right? Maybe I'm wrong."

kutwijf,"I think that might happen, but I'm guessing Bronn gets killed then Jaime gets captured."
kutwijf,"I think Syrio either ran (what do we say to death?) or grabbed a sword and disarmed Trant. 

I don't believe he's dead, but it's definitely a possibility."
kutwijf,"No, I didn't change my mind. Maybe you're confused?
"
kutwijf,"I agree his death came too soon, but I'm guessing it had to happen."
kutwijf,I fell in love with a show that didn't hold back for fear of offending the viewer.
kutwijf,"Pretty much. Just another reason why I enjoy the show. The ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" are still human."
kutwijf,"He's playing Roose too though, and betting on Stannis or am I wrong?

Nobody is going to be invading the Vale anytime soon."
kutwijf,"Except he burns innocent people alive, whereas the dude who got ate by Daenerys dragons probably wasn't innocent."
kutwijf,How Stanissesque of a response.
kutwijf,True. Things might be different had Bran listened to his mum/kept his promise about not climbing.
kutwijf,"Or just hear me out.. the choreography isn't great, and I can't understand how the director would settle for this. "
kutwijf,"The only fair fight was with Loras, and Loras is a much better jouster. His older brother Garlan is a far better swordsman. Sandor would beat Brienne had he not been weak due to his infection. Her fight with Jaimie wasn't a fight. He would have beat her if he were not malnourished etc. "
kutwijf,I'm sure Cersie convinced Olyver to testify. 
kutwijf,It'll make him a stone cold killer.
kutwijf,"If you mean fair by fighting dirty then yeah. If Jon was to also fight dirty, he would beat Karl. Jon was also at a disadvantage using a longsword in a confined area.

Locke is a better fighter than Karl."
kutwijf,"It isn't confirmed, no."
kutwijf,"According to Westerosi standards, she consented."
kutwijf,"Mace Tyrell

Maester Pycell"
kutwijf,I think you're right.
kutwijf,No love for Daario or Jorah? 
kutwijf,He wasn't. Just subdued. In the show I don't think he was even there.
kutwijf,I like you.
kutwijf,"I agree. Maybe it was just a shortcut and or Jorah didn't want Tyrion to be seen. Yeah, I don't know."
kutwijf,"No, I don't believe he would. I think he was just saying that. His extreme comment pretty much spelled that out.. that he wouldn't, but *that* stance is expected."
kutwijf,"Yes, but the weight allows ""Ice"" to be wielded as if it were a smaller blade. I don't get how it's irrelevant. The lighter weight can add speed to a swing, but also allow the user to swing it longer before tiring out."
kutwijf,Looks awesome. Great job!
kutwijf,She also crucified 163 masters. 
kutwijf,Am I the only one who thinks this dude is the leader of the Sons of the Harpies?
kutwijf,And? He could tell them what happened to him and that he escaped or that he was let go. They got paid already. It's not like they would return him. He is a great smith and would probably fight for them too!
kutwijf,"Valyrian steel was not only stronger/durable but also lighter. Take ""Ice"" for instance. It was a massive blade that looked as if it would only be used for executions, but it could actually be wielded in battle."
kutwijf,That these guys have an important role to play.
kutwijf,"It's plenty lighter than any other blade its size, so I can't full agree."
kutwijf,"It would have been nice to see more of Dorne.

Hope we see again at some point: Blackfish, Brotherhood Without Banners, Gendry, Greatjon/Rickon/Osha.

Dany, Arya and the KL lot, feel a bit meh, but they should be picking up.

I'd like to see more of the Greyjoys, but that last scene with Yara left a bad taste in my mouth.

The Sand Snakes introduction scene was too much, too soon. No wonder it's getting so much hate.

Everything else is great. Overall, I'm enjoying the season so far.








"
kutwijf,I thought for a second that he went to the tower to light the candle and Ramsay happened to be there.
kutwijf,"If sleeping with him was part of her plan, is it still rape?"
kutwijf,Remember the flashback scenes? She's even insufferable as a child. 
kutwijf,"I think so too, but Game Face Mace isn't as stupid as he seems."
kutwijf,"Sam was beaten up and helpless. Gilly didn't ask him if he wanted sex. Consent is the presence of ""yes"" not the absence of ""no"". Consent is never implied and not assumed. Gilly raped sam  *triggered* *triggered*"
kutwijf,"Exactly. Too soon D&amp;D, too soon.

What's the rush? They could go 8 or 9 season's, but they are fastforwarding to make 7. I'm sure there's more then enough material in the books yet to be written/published."
kutwijf,"Does anyone know how Littlefinger came across that Valyrian steel dagger? 

Does it have a name?

Why he would bet such an item is beyond me. "
kutwijf,Yeah or the hounds.
kutwijf,That she might be bipolar.
kutwijf,Even though he's made it clear that he cares not for money or possessions.
kutwijf,Exactly.
kutwijf,"But she knew this would happen and agreed to it, no? You're saying that she wouldn't have continued to undress if Ramsay didn't say ""don't make me ask again""? So if Theon wasn't there, it wouldn't have been rape? What if she was intent on going through with it either way? The line seems awfully blurry. "
kutwijf,"The kingsguard listen to Tommen. They were going to act, but he put his hand up."
kutwijf,"By that I meant, I think you are mistaken. 

You are applying modern standards to a medieval fantasy show. On the show, she was not raped. Today you could argue marital rape. Would I call it brutal? No. Not to mention we didn't actually see anything.

There *has* been scenes depicting rape, according to Westerosi standards, but this is not one of them.

&gt;This show has always had sexual violence if you get triggered by that you shouldn't be watching this show and you have only yourself to blame.

kutwijf,"Mace will hire a faceless man to kill Trant when he suspects he is to be killed.

No, I don't know, but I doubt he will be killed off. He probably isn't as stupid as he seems."
kutwijf,Exactly this.
kutwijf,"Is it 700 feet high, because I've heard people say 600 and others 500. This came up last time when we were discussing the battle of last season."

I do feel bad for Tommen though. I mean the kid is scared. The only person giving him guidance, died."
kutwijf,No. It could have gone further tbh.
kutwijf,It was a ridiculous question.
kutwijf,"You're right. In Astapor for example. That scene where she gets the Unsullied, was awesome!"
kutwijf,"If any are still alive, they're probably maesters or septons, or were married off into other houses."
kutwijf,"I figured that by the gif. 

I was just commenting off the title."
kutwijf,"What do you mean by soft? Well groomed? Soft spoken? Weak physically? Littlefinger for instance, isn't macho, but I don't consider him feminine. As far as perfumed... I mean people with money can afford to be clean and smell nice.

Brienne exhibited masculine characteristics, I agree. What do you think of Loras? He's gay, but is he feminine? No.

I didn't know his ""little birds"" were mostly children, but how is that relevant here?

In modern society, I'd think men would be more interested in grown women. They tend to know what they are doing sexually, they can take care of themselves, and they don't play all these mind games so less bullshit. "
kutwijf,"Agreed. I want to love Dany, but she gets me so frustrated. "
kutwijf,They could give us a half 8th season then finish with a 3h+ movie. That would be pretty badass. 
kutwijf,;D
kutwijf,"There were seven of them. Even if they did form one, are you positive they could not be flanked? I mean they had guys on either side of them. Are we sure there wasn't any side entrances to the corridor? 

Maybe they were just overconfident and didn't think a phalanx was necessary? Maybe they've grown soft/undisciplined from visiting the brothels? 

Who knows why they didn't get into formation, but I think it's realistic that they're not perfect, or invincible. "
kutwijf,God I hope this is true. I want for once for Dany to be clever.

You can milk your prostate without having to stick a dick up there."

kutwijf,I had a similar feeling after seeing that scene between him and Dany. ItÂ´s like weÂ´ve come to expect this sort of thing. 
kutwijf,Meth Gendry.
kutwijf,I wonder if Daenerys ever slept with Viserys.
kutwijf,"I mean I hope it's not him. If shit starts becoming *that* obvious in Game of Thrones, I will lose interest pretty fast. "
kutwijf,"Yeah, and that happened in episode 6 too. Weird coincidence."
kutwijf,She's basically his little sister.
kutwijf,Great reply. Thank you!
kutwijf,"[Minor Spoiler](#s ""We see him fight again in S03E09 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dII-NmjpA"")"
kutwijf,I like your take on the matter.
kutwijf,"&gt;Unless you somehow think that Ramsey would have respected her telling him no...

Well we don't know, because she never said no. 

&gt;Ok, this is straight up disturbing that you think her taking her clothes off in any way is good enough for consent unless you're ignoring absolutely all context surrounding the event. I mean we are shown that Sansa is essentially a prisoner, she's locked in a room all day until Ramsey comes at night to beat and rape her. She is covered in bruises and pleads with Reek to help save her, yet you're maintaining that everything is all good and consensual. 

Read my previous comments. I am talking about the scene that caused all the uproar... her wedding night.

"
kutwijf,I feel like that would get annoying rather quickly.*
kutwijf,Revenge. Maybe power at some point.
kutwijf,She could have at least had him executed in private. 
kutwijf,"Cersie wanted him so she could feel like she has some power again and to exact revenge on Margery via Loras. Only problem is, she is basically condemning herself. The High Sparrow is not on her side. "
kutwijf,"Besides being trained to fight as a unit, Spartans were also trained to fight solo. Were the unsullied know for that?"
kutwijf,"The editing you mean? I agree.
 
I don't think the acting is the issue. It's the writing/directing here."
kutwijf,"They could always fall back to the Dreadfort if possible. Having Sansa still ensures loyalty from other houses, but I mean if they were surrounded etc, she might be used as a bargaining chip.

He's probably hoping that Sansa would speak/vouche for him if that time came."
kutwijf,"No I got it just fine. Those soldiers are still loyal to the Tyrells, as are their people in the Reach. 

But even just in KL people like Maergery because she helped the poor. Not to mention the food their house supplies to the capital.

The High Sparrow and Faith Militant might be apart of the 99% but I would not root for them."
kutwijf,It was a gift. As was the flayed old woman. ;)
kutwijf,Never blame the writing or directing. Always blame the actor. /s
kutwijf,The Duggars seem like nice people too.
kutwijf,"&gt;She ignores advice?

She has in the past."
kutwijf,brothels weddings and politics 
kutwijf,Plus this controversial scene might put Theon into a redemption arc.
kutwijf,"True.

I think it would've been better had she already slept with Littlefinger, then we could get behind her ""playing Ramsay"" but as it stands, she has been acting like KL Sansa, apart from the Bathtub scene with Myranda. Which was awesome btw."
kutwijf,"You're trying to apply today's standards to a medieval fantasy show. 

I'm not looking to argue, but I think those arguments hold weight.

She willingly married him. So that is the yes you were looking for. The bedding ceremony is to consummate the marriage. This is normal.

I was pretty sure that she began to undress when he asked her to take off her clothes. "
kutwijf,"""Brutal"" because she was losing her virginity? It's possible that he was rough with her, but we don't actually see anything. We can presume it.

She's very clearly being raped now, but was she on her wedding night is the question. Also, if people are triggered by seeing rape, even if it's off screen, why do they watch a show like Game of Thrones?"
kutwijf,Is Mareen larger than Volantis and Braavos?
kutwijf,"Well we also thought Sansa was going to become a player, but..."
kutwijf,"True. I hope that's the case.

I misspoke there. I mean you could make an assumption based on what D&amp;D has said, but it *would* be nice to get some clarification on the matter. "
kutwijf,Season 1 Mountain is best Mountain
kutwijf,"Point taken, but that's not what I'm arguing."
kutwijf,This is what I was thinking.
kutwijf,Oberyn's account of her as a child made me hate her even more.
kutwijf,"Doran is chilling there because of his gout.

Yeah, I was hoping we'd see mote of Dorne than just the water garden.."
kutwijf,Lets hope.
kutwijf,Exactly. They are coming off of last year (which has probably been the most impactful) and trying to build things up again. People are being over critical and whiny.
kutwijf,"Who cares about the outrage. Those people don't have to watch the show!

I thought it was a great episode for the most part. "
kutwijf,"I think you are being far too critical. It's a show. 

But just to humor you, I don't think they expected much from this ""old man"", plus they outnumbered him. He had that advantage on top of being a champion fighter. I do agree that the Unsullied shouldn't have been defeated so easily. I mean spear vs knife is a no-brainer. Reach is everything. I didn't really care for where the fight took place either, but besides that, pretty enjoyable scene. 

Did Barristan die? 

Dany has already made dumb decisions left and right. 
"
kutwijf,"Boardwalk Empire s1-3. 

4 was decent. 5 was meh."
kutwijf,"Tommen has Kingsguard, Lannister guards, and the City Watch.. yet he calls upon none of them to squash this resistance. He won't even do it for pussy. It's absurd."
kutwijf,"I have a feeling that [the High Sparrow is](#g ""a Reyne."")"
kutwijf,"&gt;I feel like you're missing my point. 

Maybe.

You could probably say that the law requiring them to consummate the marriage (which she agreed upon) is coercion. 

I don't agree. I think she could have said no. This is Sansa we're talking about. Even after she had seen Theon, she was still pushing her limits. She always has, even with Joffrey. 

&gt;Just because she may or may not have known that Ramsey was going to rape her does not mean that it isn't rape.

What? She knew they were going to have sex. You're saying that it would have been rape even if he hadn't told Theon to stay. Which is not right, because she was already taking her clothes off."
kutwijf,He said something along the lines of that when Sam assumed that he must've been with plenty of women before.
kutwijf,"Also Dorne - Jaime and Bronn, Myrcella, Sand Snakes, Doran, Areo Hotah."
kutwijf,"We want quality special features like behind the scenes, the making of, interviews, bloopers etc to exist first, but also to be exclusive to the dvd/blu ray, otherwise what's the point of purchasing the dvd when HBO uploads special features and specials to YouTube?

You can make the case/box spiffy, but that won't encourage me to buy. "
kutwijf,"""Well ok, sort of half cuddle half rape."""
kutwijf,"I think once he hit the mainland (fingers crossed), he'd probably seek out the Brotherhood without banners. Either that or he's set up someplace working as a blacksmith. Maybe in the same village where Hot Pie is at?"
kutwijf,Toxic. Worse than the WoW community.
kutwijf,"4, 3, 2, 1"
kutwijf,"I agree, it wasn't that shocking. I loves Theon's reaction though."
kutwijf,Renly
kutwijf,"I've seen people say that it's feminist rape, not actual rape. Why? Because she agreed to marry him, it's the bedding ceremony, she starts to undress when asked, and never says no. Just because people don't like the idea of having sex with someone, doesn't mean they don't consent to the sex.

We as the viewer need to remember its a show that takes place in another time.

To each their own though. "
kutwijf,"Lady Olenna does run shit, but Garlan is a force to be reckoned with too. Hopefully we get to see him next season."
kutwijf,Absolutely not.
kutwijf,I'm pretty sure Cersie had everything to do with Ollyver testifying.
kutwijf,Same here.
kutwijf,Gotcha. Thx for the reply.
kutwijf,"It's all the people replaying the Bronn/Tyene scene, that's causing it. :p"
kutwijf,A ballista on some type of swivel device that could also be cranked up and down.
kutwijf,But where would she send him to fight now? 
kutwijf,"No, I don't think so. Though he has every reason to be upset with him. 

Jaimie knows how Tyrion has been treated by Tywin. "
kutwijf,"Sure it was easy for Jaimie and Bronn to get into the place, but the scene didn't get terrible until the Sand Snakes arrived. The writing and directing was really sub par. I mean they couldn't even fix that scene in editing ffs."
kutwijf,Now *That* would be noticeable. 
kutwijf,"With how the actors talked up this particular scene, I assumed we'd see more. I mean it's not like we haven't seen worse.. like Dany and Drogo or Craster's. Slightly disappointed to think that they would hold back because of certain people being up in arms over ""rape"" scenes."
kutwijf,"Well, it was either the Greyjoys or the Martells. They didn't have time for both. It's really about what's most relevant, and then streamlining storylines. Hell, they didn't even have enough time to introduce us to the Snakes before giving us that scene, which was a bummer. Hopefully things get down there."
kutwijf,"[Just speculation..](#g ""I think she has Jorah fight, but people get upset when he won't kill the guy he has defeated. Dany comes to his aid, but only to be surrounded by Harpies. He either dies here or redeems himself."") "
kutwijf,"Did we not see the ""rape"" because the show runners were worried about offending people? Because that's not the Game of Thrones I fell in love with.

Though, I think how they did it really worked well, focusing on Theon's reaction. "
kutwijf,You don't have to be enthusiastic about sex to consent to it.
kutwijf,"But like Grenn, Selmy isn't dead in the books. Everyone can relax."
kutwijf,"No, you're thinking of the Super Adventure Club. "
kutwijf,"Cersie made it happen to fuck with Margery. This way she could deny having anything to do with it.

Tommen wouldn't because he's a little bitch. He didn't act there because Cersie didn't protest. "
kutwijf,He threw Bran from the window mainly to protect his and Cersie's children from Roberts wrath.
kutwijf,Well put. 
kutwijf,I always figured white walkers and dragons.
kutwijf,The stones on the eyes are therapeutic.
kutwijf,"Thanks for the heads up. 

IMDB forums are also filled with spoilers. So. Many. Trolls. The place is a fucking cesspool. "
kutwijf,lol!
kutwijf,"5 Kingsguard + at least 6 Lannister guards would win I think.

Also, I don't think anyone would dare hurt Tommen."
kutwijf,"Those two definitely belong in the meme, especially Craster's! Maybe someone will fix this and repost."
kutwijf,"Different sure, but if people die on the show, It's safe to assume they will die at some points in the books."
kutwijf,Checkmate
kutwijf,It'll probably be Hizdahr. It seems the obvious choice with Dany ignoring his pleas.
kutwijf,"Them running away like that was bad. The Greyjoys being completely omitted from the show is even worse.

But I guess they just aren't important enough. =/"
kutwijf,Is that Tyrion?
kutwijf,"Melisandre just doused it in glitter, so no, sadly."
kutwijf,"I don't know why they went with the Sand Snakes over the Greyjoys. I mean they still could have done Dorne with Doran. They thought the Sand Snakes would be popular because of Oberyn, but everything is all wrong.

 What am I trying to say? There wasn't enough time to get properly acquainted with them. We also have no reason to root for them, and after that fight, no reason to fear them. On top of all that, add bad dialogue, them happening upon Myrcella at the same time as Jaimie and Bronn, and a cheesy fight scene. I just don't know what the hell they were thinking."
kutwijf,"Hmm so will the big fight this season be at Winterfell, Mareen, Kings Landing or Dorne?"
kutwijf,"No, they just don't like whiny bitches. 

It's one big balancing act really. Be realistic. There's only so much the showrunners can do. 

If you don't want to watch, then don't."
kutwijf,"&gt;Have you been watching the show? Do you understand Ramsey's character at all?

*I* know that Ramsay isn't above sexual assault and doesn't care if she doesn't want sex, but does Sansa? 

&gt;So you are going to ignore all context surrounding the event, apparently. I mean Ramsey is tormenting her, clear as day starting with her wedding night, I really don't know how else to explain this to you.

No. Again, read my previous comments. I say that she is being raped, night after night. I'm just not so sure that the what we saw on her wedding night was rape. You know, that scene that caused people to quit watching the show?
"
kutwijf,Fresh pasta exists!
kutwijf,"Speaking of that, what was the damage? He got cut in the back of his legs, then stabbed in the back, then the gut? I don't remember."
kutwijf,"He could also binge watch Harry Potter, Star Wars or James Bond."
kutwijf,Black Death
kutwijf,Who is this Little finger guy that everyone keeps talking about?
kutwijf,"""Feed them till they're full"" -Karl Tanner

Awe, what a nice guy."
kutwijf,"I guess it could be considered a poleaxe, but the blade doesn't seem that wide. "
kutwijf,"Ah, that's right. "
kutwijf,"Dany makes dumb decisions. Dorne is meh, so far. Kings Landing is not as interesting as previous seasons, but I think this will change in the next few episodes. Greyjoys being cut out was shitty. I would have liked to see more from certain characters that have ""gone missing"", but they're just not relevant atm. Besides those things, everything else on the show is pretty spot on."
kutwijf,"Nice, so her Dothraki are still with her. "
kutwijf,"Double standards.

But also people are desensitized to violence."
kutwijf,"So before that, they must've been more frequent for a time, because Tyrion has seen 9 and he's like 33 or 34. I wonder how uncommon it is for a summer to last as long as it has."
kutwijf,"I wonder, could he have been taken captive or sold into slavery out of Hardhome?"
kutwijf,[Perrier's Bounty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1003034/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_22) is also worth a watch.
kutwijf,"I found out the same way that he was ""dead"". I didn't think he was dead, and despite what people are saying, I don't think he dies until this next episode. "
kutwijf,"This needs to be a thing. GoT Monopoly is available, and Risk will be coming out soon.

Great job btw!"
kutwijf,"That thought had crossed my mind, but I was hoping it was just because he isn't used to being affectionate. "
kutwijf,I hope the show can succeed in filling the void left by by this actors departure.
kutwijf,"I'm saying that I don't think the Brotherhood knew that Melisandre planned on sacrificing him. I could be wrong though.

&gt;since the Brotherhood is loyal to her I just kind of group them together.

Ahh, I getcha."
kutwijf,"It wasn't rape as far as the shows goes.

By today's standards, it is.

We've seen much worse on the show, like murder or attempted murder."
kutwijf,"... 

&gt;And still didn't address the weird quotation marks around rape.

I put the quotation marks there for two reason. 

1) She knew she was going to have to sleep with him. 

2) It's normal for them to consummate their marriage. 

I don't know if the scene depicted rape. Hence the quotation marks.

"
kutwijf,"That, Deadwood and Boardwalk would've continued and been finished properly if it wasn't for HBO cutting them short."
kutwijf,I don't know why they wouldn't just threaten to put a price on your head if you don't pay them back. I mean the faceless men's base of operation is just down the road. Funding someone's enemies seems like a waste of time and money.
kutwijf,"How about Dany being at the fighting pit the same time Jorah is there? Or the Sand Snacks showing up in the water gardens at the same time as Bronn or Jaime. I mean, is this lazy writing or do they have no other choice due to time constraint."
kutwijf,Khal Drogo had daggers also if I'm not mistaken. That and he looked pretty agile.
kutwijf,"[Minor Spoilers](#b ""So it was Roberts blade. Mind kinda blown. I still would like to know more about it. Like how he came to own it. Did it have a name. I think it's a pretty badass dagger. Now I guess it's in Littlefingers possession."") "
kutwijf,http://jezebel.com/5939635/the-duggars-are-an-evil-cult
kutwijf,And you're not as smart as you think you are so cut the shit!
kutwijf,"I think Bronn was looking towards Lady Arryn to stop the fight, but she didn't. Ser Vardis' loyalty and devotion probably kept him from yielding.

But yes, I believe you can yield, though it might be shameful."
kutwijf,"Probably Tyrion, seeing as how he has experience, and Varys can vouche for him."
kutwijf,"Maybe Cersie threatened him or told him that he'd be rewarded if he testified. Remember, we seen him leaving the brothel. We never see him taken by the Faith. Also, He made it seem as if he was just doing Loras' bidding."
kutwijf,Only Pope Francis is actually a cool dude who preaches tolerance.
kutwijf,Probably with the Reeds or Umbers.
kutwijf,"Well, they *are* water gardens. Are they supposed to be hard to get into/well defended? Plus Jaimie and Bronn weren't just disguised as Dornish soldiers, but they rode in behind a line of folk as if they were escorting them. Furthermore, they basically said they don't have much of a plan and was going to wing it.

What I didn't like was:

Them all getting there at the same time. 

The fight. It could have been better. 

Obara's lines."
kutwijf,"The few vs the many retort is ridiculous though, because the Tyrell army would still walk all over any uprising KL could throw at them."
kutwijf,"I realize they haven't mentioned him yet, but you know for a fact that we won't be seeing or hearing about him on the show? 

I guess maybe it's a little late to introduce him."
kutwijf,It's poor writing/directing if anything.
kutwijf,Jorah means Dany. Tyrion is probably thinking Cersie.
kutwijf,I wonder where Robert got the blade.
kutwijf,"2h Jaimie (Aragorn may have more experience, but I still say Jaimie takes this)

Smaug (Intelligent)

Saruman

Wargs (Larger + can be armored)

Ice (Valyrian steel)

Tyrion

Nazgul (Flying + Witch King Magic) Tough one though.

Mag the mighty (Intelligent)

The Mountain (It would be cool to see him and Elendil fight)

Boromir

Bronn in a duel

The Unsullied (Fighting as a unit + shield formation) though the Uruk-Hai are larger and have better armor. This is another tough one.

Brienne

Helm's Deep over Castle Black

Samwise

Children of the forest (Greenseers and Magic)

Theon, not Reek

The Hound

Sauron"
kutwijf,"Well he *was* a kid, what did you expect? 

The adults are the ones who are supposed to know better."
kutwijf,Has she seen any of the other seasons?
kutwijf,Totally rad scar tattoos*
kutwijf,Jorah vs Stannis would be a good fight. I think Jorah would take it though. 
kutwijf,"He's confident, good looking, and fearless. She was already kinda swooning over him, but it was his persistence and daring that sealed the deal."
kutwijf,I love seeing how much she is enjoying herself with the role.
kutwijf,"When Tyrion couldn't bring himself to fuck that whore in Volantis.

No but seriously it was that scene with Stannis and his daughter. Who wasn't touched by that? Littlefinger might've even shed a tear."
kutwijf,I actually think he was thinking about Brienne when he said it. I don't think Cersie ever loved Jaimie the way he loved her. She is indeed a hateful woman.
kutwijf,"He may get help from Kevan. If Cersie gets any help, it'll be from Qyburn. Littlefinger may help get rid of Olyver, since he's obligated to help Lady Olenna. "
kutwijf,"Best? Castle Black or Blackwater 

Just favorites:

Jon Snow vs Half hand

Brienne vs those three Stark soldiers

Rodrick, Bronn and Tyrion vs the hill tribesmen"
kutwijf,"I think you're mistaken about where I get my ""information"".

If you'd open your eyes, you would see that I'm not wearing a tin foil hat."
kutwijf,Plus they've already cut out and streamlined so much shit. We might end up getting an 8th season.
kutwijf,TIL both him and that new pirate guy are both in The Thing prequel.
kutwijf,So much this. 
kutwijf,Don't forget right of the first night. That's pretty despicable.
kutwijf,"Rickon was also having dreams of Ned being in the crypt, remember?"
kutwijf,"It's clear that people think his death wasn't a good one, but I strongly disagree. "
kutwijf,"People have said that these guys were ""mooks"" etc unskilled fighters, but notice how the first dude with the mask looks and moves after they surround the unsullied. Yes, I think these are pit fighters."
kutwijf,"Just re-watched the scene. So there was 7 unsullied vs at least 20 sons of the harpies. The corridor looks 8 or 10 feet wide? There seems to be entrances on the side, not just at each end. How do I explain why the unsullied acted as they do? I don't know. They should have formed a shield wall, I agree. 

I do think that if those pit fighters? were ordered/paid by the masters to kill, they would have continued to fight regardless of the circumstances. They did have numbers on their side. "
kutwijf,"But he didn't go without a fight, and what a fight it was.

Let me explain, ""thugs"" can still be a threat when in numbers. This guy wasn't in an open field fighting in armor, he was in a small space, surrounded by dudes trying to kill him. Selmy saw he was outnumbered and still ran in anyways. I can't believe people are mocking him."
