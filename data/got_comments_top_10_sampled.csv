38461361,Craftlords,Lol that is amazing xD
44834430,Craftlords,Hopefuly the new book will be out around the time I finish the others ;P
21894746,Craftlords,He said it in the episode: Pirates won't go near that place.
50010740,Craftlords,With those clothes he will be dead when he tries to sit on the Iron Throne.
50360856,Craftlords,"Bad is serious the wrong word. It isn't as action packed and fast as last seasons, but definitely very good!"
44392817,Craftlords,"Don't you remember, they are dead Hodor killed them ;D They aren't in this season, because they where going to fast with there story I though."
50343584,Craftlords,That is an amazing name for it ;D
42667898,Craftlords,Episode 7 was yesterday on tv. Do you still have to make a topic about this. Pls stop!
48609220,Craftlords,"I had this one on the list, loved it! Thx ;P"
43176597,Craftlords,And funny as hell ;D But serious seeing those 2 guys (Tyrion and Jorah) together is really great. Even though Jorah isn't a very big part of the story I am in love with that guy!
47150862,Craftlords,I love those little things ;P
54055793,Craftlords,I wish I could say this ;P Have fun watching!
38457064,Craftlords,And she does look cute too while I though she was quite ugly in the show xD
50242809,Craftlords,He is such an amazing character in the books! 
19743477,Craftlords,"I do love Ser Friendzone more. I assume you mean Jorah, right?"
34465548,Craftlords,I like your sarcasm ;D
21905001,Craftlords,"Bye then.
"
46489050,Craftlords,"Dany and her dragons are nothing similar then for example Sansa and Lady (her direwolf). And where did you hear someone say that they are her genetically children? I don't think people actually think those three dragons came out of her. And even if you stay with the point ""Those eggs weren't hear, she isn't there mother"" look around you. Do you know someone who did adopt a child?"
51104419,Craftlords,"That's why I ask. I know, I see people seeing it over and over again, but I want some opinions about that."
50244350,Craftlords,And she will take Tyrion as her advicer? I don't see that happening. 
37912867,Craftlords,This is awesome ;D So funny and just look how great actor Alfie is. Just his face!
34861102,Craftlords,"""It's insane how people think **Tommen** should have attacked the Faith Militant"""
44595549,Craftlords,I know right. I have read the first 3 books and book 4 is coming soon here ;D
51169920,Craftlords,You can't just forget the story of the almighty JORAH!
38455583,Craftlords,Have already seen it. Amazing as hell ;P
50070510,Craftlords,I believe he didn't want to be a king and wouldn't want anything to do with all the politics. 
44272070,Craftlords,Lets fund that bad porno.
36403398,Craftlords,"I feel so bad for them too, because they know all this hate. It isn't like a few people don't like them. Just serious all of the fans are hating on them. But they got there money either way, which is nice ;D"
36490079,Craftlords,"Yeah true, but still liked it ;D"
46425020,Craftlords,"Not really. Don't show weakness or that people could fuck with you. It shows who is the boss. It wasn't needed in this situation, but you never know. Look at Cersei last episode leaving her guards, because she tought the High Septon was harmless."
18755404,Craftlords,"Jorah is a good man, I hope he will get some respect from his cruch before his time is over ;("
20415068,Craftlords,I have never heard it before and tried to hide my laugh at work. ;)
37949515,Craftlords,They both are for sure ;D I just like Alfie a bit more.
44348369,Craftlords,Is she kills Jorah I am done xD He can't die! Hopefully Tyrion will do some good words!
51175154,Craftlords,I don't CARE. Rapidy rape rape! 
32472019,Craftlords,And people are saying that Dany never got raped. 
52833051,Craftlords,"The dumbest thing to do is start around book 4. Just start with book one. There are so many stories that aren't told in the show and you will get to know a lot more. Skip the first 3 books and, in my eyes, you could better skip all the books. "
43207792,Craftlords,Winter is really coming yes.
18872830,Craftlords,"I though the same when she said it, then she mentioned the marrige.."
50021307,Craftlords,"Then it is a little bit harder, but the wifey can wait right!
"
50340933,Craftlords,"Agreed, but that is not the question ;P"
44835687,Craftlords,With the children. 
21889745,Craftlords,You can't be serious right? xD
42663937,Craftlords,"I watch in good quality and never had this problem. Some scenes are meant to be dark, but pitch black never. I can see everything fine and could count the amount of stones in a wall."
46217792,Craftlords,"I sounded a bit harsh, right.. Sorry for that ;D"
34400616,Craftlords,"Okay, that one made me laugh xD You got me good ;D"
21902379,Craftlords,"Yep, I am going to watch this movie!"
38471103,Craftlords,So you're fine by watching this if you have seen the first 4 seasons ;)
44393975,Craftlords,Sansa and Littlefinger isn't really a thing. Littlefinger is just playing for himself.
46309326,Craftlords,Mod-free week? What is that for bullshit?
37842505,Craftlords,"It was when Jaimy said: ""It's a threat."" And then Cersei 'screams: ""Of course it's a threath! I will burn there city's to the ground if they touch her!"". "
44302929,Craftlords,"I'm sure it will still be Game of Thrones, but correct me if am wrong. ;3"
31073687,Craftlords,You know what is worse.. I feel more sorry for Theon at this point. I find him really sad and I hope he will kill that Ramsey. God sake!
51141042,Craftlords,The book Daario had blue hair I though... don't fit both actors. So I am just glad we have this guy now ;D
31069714,Craftlords,"And hopefully Tommen will die soon. Not just for Cersei, but he is just a kid that can't be a king."
21906026,Craftlords,Everyone hated that movie ... just everyone.
30601120,Craftlords,"Khal Drogo raped here, there is no need for discussion right? It's just a fact. "
50376237,Craftlords,I like 'the new' Daario much more. I don't know he just is great.
45158982,Craftlords,"Varys isn't fucking. You know he doesn't have a doorbel down there, right?"
44298681,Craftlords,"Well Sansa and Geoffrey haven't met yet, so how could we pick one?"
54058757,Craftlords,Your forgot her brother? Not all the Targaryens are like Dany. 
51168812,Craftlords,"Most of the time I am just watching and after the episode I am like: ""Wtf.. What the .. fuck happend here! No way! No he can't be death!"". But last episode I was really celebrating when Cersei got in that jail ;)"
32322760,Craftlords,"They have some kind of religious cult so yeah it is a sin, and look Cersei has now Loras, but more important the queen locked down ;p"
46143783,Craftlords,"A digital painting is a painting. It's the same thing, but different material is used. And then I am talking about the people who really work with those drawing tablets (or even a mouse) and don't use photo's and put it all together. Look at some timelapse on Youtube. And look at a few comics, most of them are made digital too.

Although I agree with you that a painting like this is way more impressive then a digital one ;D"
50011565,Craftlords,"Stannis is a man of honor, and those wo are traitors die!"
19742554,Craftlords,Is she really going down that way? I like her more when she was with Khal. 
43217318,Craftlords,"I don't like spoilers, but if that is true I am all in for it ;D"
46302624,Craftlords,"Her oath was also protecting her king, which died because of Stannis. And she takes that very serious, but if it comes to a chose she should go for Sansa.."
44269351,Craftlords,http://img.pandawhale.com/post-42168-Tyrion-confused-speechless-gif-fCwP.gif
19741757,Craftlords,"I already said that, but I don't count that as a dead. It's like a walker died in the Walking Dead."
18867918,Craftlords,"I missed that, what did he say?"
48617325,Craftlords,dravirys
18740620,Craftlords,I did exactly though it would happen this episode after the whole thing that did go down last episode (which felt like a whole month if you know what I mean &gt;.&lt;).
49971424,Craftlords,"I haven't read all the books yet and I didn't really know what happend. You see him walking in a tower and then... Ramsay sitting there. From that point of view two things are possible. I didn't think Theon would help her in the first place so I had a feeling, but didn't know for sure."
44306460,Craftlords,I was kind of joking too. The acting was really great and it was really Game of Thronisch. If you understand what I mean.
50321944,Craftlords,But why do people think Dany would be overly happy with Tyrion. It is a Lannister. She isn't gonna give him everything he wants? What do I not see?
19943227,Craftlords,No good answer.
44285888,Craftlords,Fixed the title: Heroic old lady not to speak under Ramsay's torture?
32323377,Craftlords,Just 4 more episodes... 
50359389,Craftlords,"Memorial Day weekend or somehting like that last episode, so that's why a lot less people."
51148058,Craftlords,"Didn't really though about it like that, but some people here are like Dany and Tyrion are going to be the best mates. Maybe he will get to fly on a dragon, but that would be because he is small..."
47047440,Craftlords,What would the spoil? Like you can't spoil anything in Game of Thrones.
51397138,Craftlords,"Yep, they did ;P"
46483527,Craftlords,My real question is how many of those feminist claiming to be big fans of the show did really stop watching Game of Thrones? Or where even watching the show before.
44299767,Craftlords,"And there goes her last fuck. Sorry, I mean food."
44397736,Craftlords,Exactly though the same ;D
44278368,Craftlords,"I haven't catched up with the books yet and for sure am not a spoiler reader, but I know who LSH is... like it is so manny times mentioned everywhere does some people still don't know who LSH should be? ;D Just curious.."
47158121,Craftlords,I feel terrible bad for him.
34459986,Craftlords,Somsthing wrung¿
37840209,Craftlords,"He even lifted his hand so that the guards would stand down. Like serious! He could fuck here all day long, but no let her take away!?"
51131084,Craftlords,"If I'm correct the story goes that Varys killd Tywin. She also knows about Jorah's loyalty even though he betrayed her. I just don't see it happening Tyrion and Dany. Although it would be very funny and kind of awesome it just... Nah, don't work for me ;s"
46425776,Craftlords,I want his character to break for so long!
48646976,Craftlords,I think I'll do a 'recap' of the North. So the first one will be in that one. And I'll use Bronn for sure xD
32905278,Craftlords,She was.
43202165,Craftlords,Please. Just please stop posting about this.
44566752,Craftlords,Littlefinger is up to something... like always ;D
34080451,Craftlords,"I knwo that feeling with other books, movies and tv shows. When people go read or watch it you wanted to tell them everything, but then there is no fun in it for them ;D"
42645554,Craftlords,They don't deserve all the hate they get simple as that.
49994755,Craftlords,This made me giggle ;D
34216956,Craftlords,Let's do that!
30606241,Craftlords,"Still had one of the wallpapers from episode 5, but now I need to change once again :D Keep 'em coming!"
49993462,Craftlords,Our grammar king. Thx didn't think of that one ;D
42693651,Craftlords,"I would rather see Tommen do something about it, but for now I don't think he would even make it till the end of this season ;S"
50024835,Craftlords,"Jon was at Castle Black and well no Walkers there (yet) and the others are nothing near them. So no Walkers is easy to understand, but most likely we will see some next episodes!"
18736721,Craftlords,I love this man. I hope he will survive this... Or just go the Lee way xD
18740931,Craftlords,What am I missing. Who do you think?
41670046,Craftlords,"Yes, but probably some big death(s) ;D"
18856943,Craftlords,"Greyscale is what Shireen, Stannis Daughter, has too. She got a lot of help from maester that came from all sides of the world. The stoneman (attacked Tyrion and Jorah) do have it. More you should just google ;)"
44272785,Craftlords,It's like Sansa...
50026940,Craftlords,No time to think of *little* things.
46304780,Craftlords,Tommen will activate Joffrey-mode.
50104915,Craftlords,"George decides while writing to split the story, because the story was getting to much for 1 book. In his eyes it wasn't smart to just cut it, but split the storys. So AFFC has (if I am correct) has the story mostly focused on Kingslanding and then ADWD focused on the other storylines.

So why people would read it like this? I don't know it is a lot more work while you basicly can enjoy the book. Just go read first AFFC and then go on with the books ;P"
50298340,Craftlords,"Yep, pls kill them all. Fake fans.

*Downvotes are coming!*"
46300591,Craftlords,If you think this has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention.
53640559,Craftlords,Amen to that xD
50022688,Craftlords,"I don't think they did show that, but it would be more then normal that they get paid. Oberyn hadn't a reason to get paid, because he probably didn't need money and came to kill the Mountain. But would you give your life for a thief? For nothing? Don't see that happening."
37940013,Craftlords,I am defintly not going to read this novel about that scene.
45312571,Craftlords,There is no Theon left. I think that is made very clear in season 4. Before he will be Theon again a lot more would need to happen and probably Ramsay would need to die.
34269380,Craftlords,"It does seems the same size to me, but from different angles it just looks different."
36404502,Craftlords,"That is funny, but that fight last episode wasn't even that bad. I mean now they are talking shit about eveyr move these girls make. "
18871137,Craftlords,They just showed it in the episode trailer. They where just done with that guy somehow.
32369227,Craftlords,"Yeah, I will read every single letter ;D"
34070910,Craftlords,"It's funnyt hat it where two woman. Those are mostly the once who are crying for... attention? Drogo raped Daenerys there is no doubt for me in that part. In the show that was pretty clear and even in de books it is too. I can't speak about Cersei rape in the books, because only read the first 3 and can't remember if that happend. She got raped and it was a pretty shit scene. In the good way, I wanted Theon to snap. He just had to jump on that prick, but he didn't. And you heard Sansa what sounded pretty fucked up.

Those woman should be called back to the show and a real fan would need to tell them what really happend in the books. I hope they don't make future decisions based on all this crying people. Just keep the rape as brutal, or even worse. This is Game of Thrones. Nobody makes you watch it, but it is a show about murder and rape is a big part of the world George created."
47046611,Craftlords,I'm with you ;D
53640325,Craftlords,Why did you use same picture for little Sam for season 1 and 5. Little Sam wasn't even born in season 1/2.
32169641,Craftlords,I really have to get those books in home. Only have read the first 3... So little time.
18875770,Craftlords,That would even be fucked up for Game of Thrones.
34396967,Craftlords,So Illan Payne isn't a hypocrites that likes chopping heads of in there spare time? 
16531045,Craftlords,Did they just showed us a dead Selmy?
38578641,Craftlords,Maybe it was that xD
47155022,Craftlords,Theon died a long time ago...
34273164,Craftlords,"People ARE upset because she got raped, because most crying woman now aren't even familair to the show but pick this up as one of there feminsm shit things. I am serious done with this. Hopefully E8 will have a way more brutal rape scene and theon don't just looks, but has to help a hand too. Goddamn leave this already. I am done with it."
34279033,Craftlords,People hate Brienne? I though she was quite funny with Pod.
46164324,Craftlords,He doesn't seem weak to me? 
44298285,Craftlords,I see more people write his name like that. Just wtf? How hard can it be xD
52801429,Craftlords,"It's a very normal question. Tyrion Lannister and Dany aren't going to be friends right away, that is for sure."
38165199,Craftlords,Better then that actor who is going to play the joker now ^^
34406593,Craftlords,"Thenk, you Stannis. de! Grammyst. Verry Thank. yoU"
45164916,Craftlords,"I've tried saying Reek and p(r)ick on many ways, don't get them to rhyme?"
46303521,Craftlords,"Still doesn't know? The old lady got killed in the last episode and we see Brienne short after that standing and watching over Winterfell. I don't think there would be days of time difference in between those moments, irght?"
44373577,Craftlords,Didn't though about it. Would be cool though ;3 Got a mancruch on Jorah xD
51341873,Craftlords,I came.
18862911,Craftlords,"""Lets give him one fight scene and get rid of that guy"" writers Got."
32323756,Craftlords,"Looks nice, but no :)"
44263206,Craftlords,"Theon told him about the candle, then Ramsay 'asked' the people who served her?"
34073657,Craftlords,"Because now there is a woman involved. And nowadays you have those weird race called 'feminism'. This race thinks that woman are everything, gods that need to be loved by everyone. And anything that shows them weak needs to go. "
50286736,Craftlords,"2,5 million viewers lost from episode 1 S5 untill now? "
37927541,Craftlords,Lol so you have watched the second episode first ;D Well no big problem there was guy that watched the Walking dead final s5 because he though it was episode 1 ... That is a bit worse xD
48394506,Craftlords,"Well he is alive, but no Theon anymore ;S "
51240906,Craftlords,"You really haven't been paying attention, didn't you?"
37915066,Craftlords,It's been almost a full week. I don't want to here one other word about this topic.
50005918,Craftlords,Most likely wll be something different.
18735545,Craftlords,"Predicatble.. nah, I don't agree with that. And who did die this episode?"
31076487,Craftlords,I have seen him saying that too. And if that was the scene then that doesn't seems right to me. Just hyping it all up.
48607265,Craftlords,Definitely gonna use this one!
49993969,Craftlords,"This one for sure, thank you!"
42662024,Craftlords,For Sam's protection and he is going to the wildlings. Bringing a big dangerous wolf with him sound like a great plan?
18731239,Craftlords,"I know that I watch Game of Thrones, but I wasn't scary he would die."
44270957,Craftlords,Literlly a dirty girl ;)
32348243,Craftlords,"This is serious a big deal for people? Come on get your shit together. YOU ARE WATCHING GAME OF THRONES! We have seen a brains all over the floor, we have seen rape scnes with naked body's. And now you get a scene like this an it is al to much. For a show like Game of Thrones it was more to less."
36373555,Craftlords,"Well sory then, but that is not what I did read."
38454783,Craftlords,I know right!
46214445,Craftlords,But do they cast for every single character this way? Isn't there a change they do some calls with actors?
53523331,Craftlords,Wasn't it 4 weeks?
46352287,Craftlords,We don't even know if that is true too ;D Tyrion could have paid those girls to say that ;P
51343627,Craftlords,Hundred and one stories from Hodor.
44225359,Craftlords,"""Oh no, the bloody Bolton bastard boy is bothered by the b word. That's blissfully brilliant."" That is the best part ;D"
50007097,Craftlords,But a murder or a thief is usually not rich and have no gold for a good fighter. 
21902007,Craftlords,"Khalisee is a good way to call her, because she is. The call Cersei the Queen too so that point isn't right ;)"
21867685,Craftlords,It sure did.
50010061,Craftlords,"I think you are right, didn't think of it like that!"
44283548,Craftlords,"""I loved them since the beginning"" every single guy here."
38383757,Craftlords,"Maybe his acting will be great, but he defintly doesn't look like a good joker to me."
50204966,Craftlords,At this point Stannis.
32166270,Craftlords,Jon Snow and Ramsey Bolton? 
46161573,Craftlords,You pirate!
44285090,Craftlords,"Maybe, but I think we could end with a Kingslanding destroyed and whole Westeros gone to shit."
37921165,Craftlords,You didn't...
18863673,Craftlords,I found that one strong argument.
51158300,Craftlords,Tyrion on a dragon burning Cersei... Yeah I would give a lot of money for that.... ;)
53638721,Craftlords,This is serious the most asked question this whole season. People google something before asking?
50111190,Craftlords,"How badly I want Theon to help Sansa, take revange, do something I can't see that happening. It is almost not possible. Look in season 2 when his own sister came to rescue him! He stayed loyal to Ramsay! And beside that it is still Game of Thrones.. I could see him being killed by Ramsay or when Stannis comes..."
51131917,Craftlords,"Yes, but HBO didn't air Game of Thrones on that day. So you would have one week no Game of Thrones."
44614095,Craftlords,You should add a spoiler onto that ;D
48339670,Craftlords,Theon died a long time ago... Well that is funny we had the exact same comment ;D
44266732,Craftlords,I think you are more then right. 
50273170,Craftlords,And the family of a thief are great fighers? Most of the poor don't even own a sword worth fighting with.
46557454,Craftlords,"You right. I mean Lady ;D I'll edit it, otherwise I look so stupid.."
19945592,Craftlords,I don't think she did that. At least not in the tv show. Not 100% sure.
18858502,Craftlords,"""Ramsay your father will have a boy, a real Bolton"" Well that would help Sansa a lot?"
21906270,Craftlords,What a cool kid!
49994275,Craftlords,"Thx! I had that one, because I just love Bealish ;)"
44352696,Craftlords,"Next to Joffrey, she likes him. But I don't think she loves him."
18880652,Craftlords,But the fighting pits are only for volunteers. In the first season I really though they would end up together (Jorah and Dany). But at that time I didn't really know what kind of story this is. Now I know better...
43209337,Craftlords,Truly great acting there!
50005066,Craftlords,I guess it is the trail episode?
37923833,Craftlords,I love littlefinger ;D I can't understand people don't like him!
34946529,Craftlords,"I really like here character and she is exactly a very funny woman, and for sure a good actress. But opinions I guess xD"
44286406,Craftlords,That would be a really good episode name for the finale.
34072201,Craftlords,"Well you aren't a Game of Thrones super nerd fan if you stop watching the show after a scene like this. Didn't she saw the brains from Oberyn? Didn't she saw Theon got tortured for god knows how long? Has she even paid attention from the beginning? Where Dany got raped too. I haven't seen this (I will), but I already hate those woman."
18882776,Craftlords,"He know he was fucking both of them, Sansa and Theon. Theon told Ramsey that he didn't kill the Stark boys. "
32902386,Craftlords,"Totally of the topic, but can I ask why you hate the Starks? All of them? "
18865876,Craftlords,"Gosh I am not the only one. Ramsay was just a fucked up guy in the last seasons, but now the story and his scenes are pretty interesting."
50192683,Craftlords,That makes sense lol ;D
39664597,Craftlords,"You didn't get my post right. I have already seen it, but told that it was amazing as hell. You see me seeing ""Thx for sharing this just with me!?"" ;)"
21865651,Craftlords,Pirates are afraid for Valyria and won't go there. 
51132754,Craftlords,"That is kind of dissapointed, but still it is a great story!"
46209117,Craftlords,I just hope you are joking.
46157822,Craftlords,"When you read the books you know a lot more, and for me when I really like something it is easy to remember things. "
46163929,Craftlords,"In the show he didn't was a very big part for the first few season, but this season he has been really great. Although I haven't read all the books yet I think he should be the king. He is the rightfull heir and he deserves it."
32166414,Craftlords,Let's just hope it is.
18861391,Craftlords,Not everyone is in for story I guess. Some just want Dragons all over the place and battles here and there.
44289460,Craftlords,Wel ha-ha-ha! At first I though you linked the wrong picture.
37839589,Craftlords,"&gt; Ramsay rapes Sansa in front of Reek. She is upset.

Well if this girl just gets a bit upset after rape I am sure she will be fine ;)"
18742141,Craftlords,"Okay, I have read some spoilers down here. I know and I want that scene now!"
34399572,Craftlords,Thenk you.
51239851,Craftlords,"Most of those feminist claiming to watch Game of Thrones, didn't even watch the show in the first place. Like serious they came up with the most stupid things xD"
42656196,Craftlords,"I guy who has to much god in his ass. Nah, not my hero."
42690930,Craftlords,"Because different opinions, I guess?

At first I liked Brans story, but it got a bit dull for me. "
50121963,Craftlords,"I am convinced that there is something going to happen, but if they are going to kill Dany off what about the dragons? And I would love to see her atleast trying to go to Kingslanding/westeros. Maybe it is going nasty with Stannis and Ramsay. We still have Theon and Sansa there."
50008566,Craftlords,But you can read the same book at the 'same time'. Use two bookmarks and when you are working your wife can read etc? But you won't regret reading them ;D I started with the first one too and although it was an amazing book it took quite a while. But the second and third book did go so fast! Now book 4 will arrive today :D
42654690,Craftlords,"Oh, I love Jorah and I am so happy he finally got back to Dany with Tyrion. At this point I am afraid they won't be friends anymore or that Jorah even can guard her, but I am glad that he may get a change of something... Don't know what Dany is going to do with Tyrion, but damn that storyline is my favorite. Jorah and Tyrion are both my favorite!

Cersei made a big mistake with letting the High Sparrow do what he wants... and I don't think that Tommen the scared king can something do about it all. My expections are that in the end of this season Kingslanding will be one big mess. I just hope Cersei will not die. I would miss her scenes. 

I though we would see more with Jon this episode, but maybe we are getting something big behind the wall. And like I said before the Sand Snakes don't deserve all this hate I still feel bad for them..."
19943902,Craftlords,I just feel sad for people who are downvoting this. How old are some people here.
53612716,Craftlords,You don't deserve those downvotes ;D 
44288154,Craftlords,He is the rightful heir. And he has been really growing on me this season. 
50270888,Craftlords,"I haven't read the book where this event happens yet and I'm a Jorah lover aswell (if that is a right name for it...), but I don't see why people think that Tyrion will be able to help Jorah out. Dany doesn't want Tyrion to be a advicer or her king? I don't think she really likes the Lannister, ritgh? But he is an amazing speecher so maybe  he will be able to get some things and he did kill his father. But Jorah will probably not be killed not by her hands. From the moment he stept in that fightingpit you could just see that Dany know it was him, or atleast though of it, and she looked proud when he slaid those men without blood. "
50019740,Craftlords,It will be either Joffrey-mode or he will die. That's what I think xD
51138444,Craftlords,"Is she in Westeros yet? Where was Varys planning to go? Where is Jorah now with Tyrion? I'm sorry, but your point sounds really stupid. Even if her story didn't effect anything: she is in MEEREEN! Not in Kingslanding and when a story doesn't effect everyone in Westeros it isn't for nothing. Like serious.. facepalm moments here."
46865909,Craftlords,Great scene ;D
32307757,Craftlords,"I think reading the whole story is more my thing, but thanks tho :P"
50027117,Craftlords,Season 5 is good.
18750852,Craftlords,"Just 10 episodes that is what I think about it. I have seen season 1,2,3 and 4 is less then 2 months so that where some intense months xD But now it is just 5 more episodes :(But I love this show!"
42692655,Craftlords,"I love it! And hopefully Tyrion can do a good word for Jorah, because I love that guy even more!"
42689113,Craftlords,"I don't know if there will be a trail by combat, is that how it works for these people?"
42642929,Craftlords,Had a good laugh about your comment ;P
34202127,Craftlords,If I hear one more thing about this I swear to you I will do way worse then rape.
38395762,Craftlords,"This doesn't spoil any story. So yes, no spoilers."
18733670,Craftlords,"I knew the moment that it was Theon when I saw all that dogs in the cages. And I am so so terrible sorry for that poor guy. I wish he would have said something like ""Sansa... they aren't dead"". "
50204459,Craftlords,Robb wanted the North. Not the Iron throne.
42659678,Craftlords,I think they are building up something big..
46328308,Craftlords,It's like the Purge in real life.
32319867,Craftlords,"I have no doubt there are chapters that you could skip and time is a bit of an issue, but I just want to read the whole story. I like all the extra stuff, and how he can fill pages and pages for just one thing. Everyone has his own thing ;D"
18729377,Craftlords,"Yes, but she got all the maesters from places everywhere to help her. Don't think Jorah will have that..."
46162453,Craftlords,Is it me or do some people go crazy when watching Game of Thrones? ;3
38454580,Craftlords,"If you only watch the show (and catched up untill season 5) you are fine by looking this. Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) sings about a death in season 1,2,3 and 4. And Jaime talks about his sister and some Ramsey and Reek jokes. They will not spoil anything more. And it is really great had a good laugh ;P"
42641949,Craftlords,"It was exactly quite good, but I liked the fighting scene in episode 6 too."
34408108,Craftlords,Yeah right! She is cool. I like her too! 
50019352,Craftlords,"That has nothing to do with the keyboard, but with the computer itself ;) But my computer doesn't autocorrect my mistakes? They show it with a red line (like in word), but don't correct it. So maybe you can google how you can turn that off?"
52926126,Craftlords,Yep this guy has a new background! I haven't seen this either how could I have missed this! My king my Jorah ;D Thank you very much for showing this it's wonderfull!
50245720,Craftlords,"Don't know why you get downvoted, but you are wrong. The question is ""who would you want to take it?"" and everyone has different opinions. Although I agree with you now ;3"
48327277,Craftlords,Yeah he did.
47209537,Craftlords,"True, let's hope he will break at one point. "
51150366,Craftlords,"It always can be better, but I know what you mean. Although I really enjoy all the things that had happened this season. Exactly quit a lot in my eyes."
51336639,Craftlords,It was...
44396420,Craftlords,Why would she marry him?
42641711,Craftlords,"They where a bit fast with his story, faster then the books I though. So he won't be in this season as far I know."
44277466,Craftlords,"Have you seen the review for episode 8 yet? The wildlings aren't like ""Hey Jonnie, let's be friends!"". So most likely there will be white walkers and they will fight together and become kind of mates. At least that is how I see it happening."
32434843,Craftlords,"Sorry, but that is just shit to me. Rape is a part of the world George created and has been in the show from season 1. Now it happend to Sansa and all of sudden it is a big deal. Theon got tortured for god knows how long. Even his penis is removed. Didn't hear a lot of people (and especially woman) crying about that. 

I hope we will see some more rape, just for this whinig."
51144963,Craftlords,"So when her story doesn't effect the people in, for example, Kingslanding it is kind of worthless? I can't agree with that. "
44304795,Craftlords,You did your research. Are you up to something...
50320292,Craftlords,"So if she doesn't become the queen her story would have been for nothing? Isn't that the point of Game of Thrones? You win or you die... there is no middle ground. Robb didn't became the king in the North, now his whole story is a worthless pile of shit?  Stannis a perennial loser? I kind of understand why (I assume you only watch the show) showwatchers don't have something with him. Atleast he was not boring for me, but I would chose someone else. But then I read the first 3 books and now with this season: Stannis is the Mannis! He is the rightfull heir and would be a very good king. Respectfull and fair. "
19944267,Craftlords,"It isn't that much? A few(er) more episode wouldn't hurt, but I haven't catched up with the books and I can easily follow everything that is going on."
50264939,Craftlords,Probably die.
44275493,Craftlords,"He is doing a serious great job, but I have been feeling that with a lot of actors on Game of Thrones lately. That besides I am in a love-hate relation with the high Sparrow ^^ "
46214053,Craftlords,What a shame. No role worthy my greatness. Maybe season 7 then.
19939411,Craftlords,"There is a way Jorah could be cured for quite some years, we have already seen in in the books and tv show. Shireen."
52805340,Craftlords,"He isn't the most important character, or the funniest, but I love this man and he is my favorite! Jorah is love!"
46208273,Craftlords,"No, nobody thinks that. That is why it has been mentioned 100 times ;)"
44628945,Craftlords,"And what she is going to do with Tyrion. I haven't caught up with the books, but I will this summer. So hopefully the books are already on this point.."
19011312,Craftlords,He looked pretty alive to me. And don't start about that guy with the dragon ;)
44562915,Craftlords,"Probably yes, but we don't know how fast it would go..."
18766543,Craftlords,Not that they never did it before ^^ But I just knew it. 
49968071,Craftlords,This is the kind of shit I really like ;D We need more of those funny posts here!
18860079,Craftlords,"Well he did look a bit weird, but I honestly don't want to believe it. It would be one hell of a twist.."
42644977,Craftlords,They are building things up. I think we are getting a season finale with some very shitty things to happen.
50386789,Craftlords,Maybe to fuck with the readers? Sounds perfect for George ;p
46140675,Craftlords,"I was never really sure about him, mostly because of the Red priest. But this season he has really been growing on me. I like him and he could be a very good king, but like you said..."
54252642,Craftlords,"""Why do you guys still argue that Stannis is the rightful king when he did something like this?"" Get your facts together, before making statements like that about our king. The rightful heir! Stannis!"
44346859,Craftlords,Viewer? Most woman who did get crazy about it didn't even know what the hell Game of Thrones was. Old ladies did go crazy on facebook about he gross it was and shit. And then they said things about the show that aren't true -.- Kill them all I would say.
34082543,Craftlords,"Ned isn't a total dick. He had to kill that guy, because that's just how it works. He ran away from the wall that is a crime. Everywhere he would be killed, but Ned took his life himself. I don't have the time now to say my thoughts, but I really don't agree with this..
"
49975676,Craftlords,"Don't we all agree that these are the kind of discussions we need here, and not that 'thing' from last episode? ;3"
21866753,Craftlords,"We can see that, ;D"
38382817,Craftlords,Wow... how could type that.. I am just going to say that it was because I was so busy with my work.
32175108,Craftlords,"That is what I though, but they where the only north bastards I could think of. So it was more a question like ""Why Jon and Ramsay, how?"""
42688131,Craftlords,"Yes, just you."
50388118,Craftlords,All the other season didn't air on Memorial Day. They skipped a week.
44569234,Craftlords,Because it is Jamie Lannister I guess?
50071503,Craftlords,Thx didn't know about that post. Although I am reading the books this is wonderfull! How much lore and history in these books is so great!
36388344,Craftlords,Nice pun.
44315844,Craftlords,"That sounds so cool ;D I feel terrible sad for Theon since the beginning and have always been hoping he will get out of it all. It won't be easy for him, but I have hope! Don't know his story in the books since I haven't read that far yet ;S"
44280093,Craftlords,"I loved it, but I love everything with Jorah and Tyrion xD"
50018088,Craftlords,Not a big fan of LOTR only seen the first 2 movies a long time ago. So I just say that everyone is asoiaf would win ;3
52191908,Craftlords,"If you say that a girl looks good it doesn't matter wich age she is, but when you call there hot she better be 18 ;D So no pedo at all xD"
19744680,Craftlords,"Have to agree with that, but I see it as a good thing. Because it doesn't get lame or boring so if they can make the series a bit longer this way and still be at great quality I don't care."
34807855,Craftlords,"Of course not, but however he is the king and there where guards. So if he just said ""Stop those fools"" then his guards would stop them."
50251706,Craftlords,"I am playing the second episode so quite a lot to catch up. But as far I have seen there are no 'game changing' choices, but definitely choices where you have to think about. And I don't know how it is going to turn out, but I let one of the characters wrote a letter which could have a different turn then those who didn't. Also the (sword) fighting is really great and you have crossbows ;D"
51103512,Craftlords,They just need to do an extra '15 minute' episode where that happens xD
48606240,Craftlords,Bit disappointed in myself that I forgot this one. Thx I'll use this one for sure ;D
44351936,Craftlords,"""She actually wants to fuck this brons out."" Aha, I'm a genius..."
32327462,Craftlords,"""I wasn't asking little princess"". How one of those girls said that was serious ridiculous. Even I could do it better, but still a like everything in Game of Thrones. "
42370951,DoubleHunter,Yes! Give them bitches the Denethor treatment!
42781206,DoubleHunter,Nimble Dick?
42606172,DoubleHunter,[Poetry eh?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxU2eqZtYmc)
42337008,DoubleHunter,"It's this or ""Kill the Boy""."
42627582,DoubleHunter,Pretty much.
38474322,DoubleHunter,They recently released a behind the scenes video where we see Iwan in a camp set with blood on his face.
24434922,DoubleHunter,The flaying of the Ironborn increased his ruthless image and ensured that there were no people to spread the word of Theon's capture.
34936649,DoubleHunter,"""He's pure evil."""
43376009,DoubleHunter,How many leechings has he had to earn that title?
34958537,DoubleHunter,Why it's not doing the books justice or why it doesn't need to do the books justice?
24281066,DoubleHunter,Ramsay.
47289423,DoubleHunter,"I'd go with James Purefoy. The Following was just cancelled, so he needs work."
22797496,DoubleHunter,"A character doesn't need to be a flawless saint for people to like him. Also, most Stannis fans on Reddit base their opinions on the books where the scenes that you listed are either very different or don't even happen."
33257801,DoubleHunter,That's interesting. Personally I think this season is a vast improvement over the last three.
46431818,DoubleHunter,"Soon to be dead: Stannis, Shireen and Selyse."
43341234,DoubleHunter,"That's apparently their plan. Of course, they could still pull an FMA on us."
38130401,DoubleHunter,"Three cures: axe, sword and cleaver."
38310704,DoubleHunter,I forgot how creepy Skyler looked in that episode.
37844541,DoubleHunter,"Tyrion has the most. Survived the Eyrie, survived the Green Fork, survived the Blackwater, survived the trial at KL, survived the Stone Men attack, survived the slavers..."
40107735,DoubleHunter,"I know why she wants to kill her in the books, but why would she kill her in the show when Sansa is so close and Brienne is clearly trying to protect her?"
42373841,DoubleHunter,Because the leeches were BS in the first place. She just saw Joff and Robb's deaths in the fires and tricked Stannis into believing that the leeches did it.
35117270,DoubleHunter,Well that's your opinion. Personally I prefer the first 6 episodes of Season 5 to the first 6 episodes of seasons 2-4.
38340674,DoubleHunter,Tony wouldn't die of one bullet anyway.
34411104,DoubleHunter,Is that a problem?
33251800,DoubleHunter,Roose did say that most of them have fled. I guess some small bands of reavers could be found here and there.
42769613,DoubleHunter,"Yes!

The Faceless Men are also annoying emo weirdos."
37819420,DoubleHunter,Hilarious.
34426146,DoubleHunter,Or when the show finally ends and we can judge it as a complete and finished product.
43109940,DoubleHunter,"Nope, unless you count Catelyn's kids."
34352231,DoubleHunter,"Yeah, they did.

I agree with you on the second half of S3 being the point where Breaking Bad turned to gold. The first half on the other hand... let's just say that it contains my least favorite part of the entire show AKA the cousins."
43254108,DoubleHunter,Or why didn't he send some soldiers outside to look for her?
42838069,DoubleHunter,Don't trust IMDB.
39501179,DoubleHunter,I never said that she wasn't the Lady of Casterly Rock in the books.
37070040,DoubleHunter,And the hand... Jesus was that fucked up.
24212660,DoubleHunter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oRmeoAt33E
42990274,DoubleHunter,"God no. Episodes 4, 5 and 6 were better than episodes 1, 2 and 3. Kissed by Fire and What is Dead May Never Die were both the second best episodes of their respective seasons. ""Sons of the Harpy"" wasn't a bad episode, and it still has what is so far the best scene of this season. As for ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unroken"". I think people are letting the Sand Snake fight (of which I would mainly blame the director) and the last scene (which I thought was very well written) cloud their judgement.

Are people forgetting the stuff that D&amp;D have pulled over the years like Talisa?"
34675636,DoubleHunter,"While we're at it, let's feed Grey Worm and Daario to the dragons and make Adebisi Dany's advisor."
43247882,DoubleHunter,"But then again, Drogon actually burned a child."
43261744,DoubleHunter,"Everyone? Hardly. Sansa not escaping is a lot more important than the lives of a couple of soldiers. Plus, they would return if the mission was a success."
43465630,DoubleHunter,I think it was Episode 4 in the scene where Mace left for Braavos.
41403316,DoubleHunter,They also mentioned that Jorah fought for the Golden Company before meeting Dany.
44376876,DoubleHunter,"Some people just hate zealots, I guess."
36618289,DoubleHunter,It would be extremely painful.
24216653,DoubleHunter,Only problem is that Littlefinger isn't smart either.
46205100,DoubleHunter,"Anything's better than ""Hear Me Roar""."
35026518,DoubleHunter,"""No godless man..."""
43371804,DoubleHunter,"It was meant as a rhetorical question, but nonetheless I like your answer."
41575980,DoubleHunter,"The books.

Roose Bolton had about 10 000 men of the Northern army under his control after the Green Fork. After he started to secretly work with Tywin he started sending the Stark loyalists in his army on suicide missions. Once he came to the Twins he had with him about 3 500 Boltons and 500 Karstarks."
42554612,DoubleHunter,You mean Captain Hook?
43210556,DoubleHunter,"He was probably dreaming or being delirious, and thought that he was a young boy again."
40275703,DoubleHunter,You'd be surprised.
36175309,DoubleHunter, [I think we both know.](http://starseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Aidan-Gillen-in-The-Dark-Knight-Rises.jpg)
38162022,DoubleHunter,"While the Cersei chapters and the Greyjoy chapters are entertaining, I have to agree with you here. Jaime's chapters are the only ones that are actually consistently well written and live up to the quality of the previous books."
49335839,DoubleHunter,"Man, are Pycelle and Qyburn really that forgettable?"
38530951,DoubleHunter,[Oops.] (http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/30500000/got-game-of-thrones-30501634-245-138.gif)
41599088,DoubleHunter,Psst. There are spoilers in the link.
32150971,DoubleHunter,It'll depend on Sansa. Sansa could divulge that Littlefinger killed Lysa and Joffrey and that he forged the Tyrell-Lannister alliance.
36932764,DoubleHunter,He learned the move pretty recently.
41024491,DoubleHunter,"1. Could you elaborate?

2. The only ones who came back for another season after their deaths that come to my mind are Charles Dance, Jason Momoa and (if he counts) Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson. Dance and Momoa had just one scene to film. That's hardly comparable to Kit having to (presumably) film dozens of scenes."
34689487,DoubleHunter,"I think tens shouldn't be given away too easily, and the Wedding Daze was one of the most atmospheric scenes that they've ever done. They should definitely bring Jeremy Podeswa back for future seasons."
38624259,DoubleHunter,Stannis.
42881772,DoubleHunter,It's the lighting.
36761652,DoubleHunter,"Some army will eventually march south from the North and Walder Frey has to return at some point. I assume that once those things start happening the Riverlands will become important again, and we'll meet the Tullys and the Brotherhood again."
42611418,DoubleHunter,It was a reference to Littlefinger's line in Episode 3.
39979937,DoubleHunter,If the Boltons actually kidnap Shireen I want Stannis to [go full on Tony Soprano on them] (https://youtu.be/qeJdVwyTFfc?t=6s).
41525097,DoubleHunter,Blackwater.
42749779,DoubleHunter,"This is character development. 

Sansa has always been a survivor not a player. This is pretty much the first time since Season 1 that Sansa has to rely on herself and make her own allies. When she was in King's Landing characters like the Hound, Tyrion and Shae came to her aid. Now the only person inside Winterfell that was helping her is dead, and she has to (presumably) take advantage of Theon's guilt to make him help her.
"
41714532,DoubleHunter,No hypeless man may watch the season finale!
42569984,DoubleHunter,"- The Walk of Shame

- Possibly Kevan and Pycelle's assassination

- Possibly Dany sailing back to Westeros

- Possibly the conclusion and aftermath of the Battle of Winterfell

- Possibly Arya sailing back to Westeros

- Possibly Jon's stabbing

- Possibly something that heavily foreshadows Jon's resurrection

- Possibly Balon's death"
40118772,DoubleHunter,Is Dany's infertility even a thing in the show?
43424231,DoubleHunter,"Perhaps, but Natalie's Margaery is on a freaking new level of transparency."
38279195,DoubleHunter,"- Cut the Sand Snakes

- Make Ellaria tolerable

- Have well written scenes with Jaime, Doran and Myrcella

- Keep up the good work you've done with Bronn

- ~~Make Trystane tolerable~~ Recast Trystane or send him to be trained by Adebisi. Kit's acting did a 180 after doing just one movie with him."
40081025,DoubleHunter,For what?
40218644,DoubleHunter,Could somebody actually go back and watch that scene in the Season 1 finale? I remember them talking about Drogo coming back but not about Dany being infertile.
42709126,DoubleHunter,"Certainly. I mean, it was probably self defense anyway."
38783660,DoubleHunter,Don't look at me. Who knows where these fan terms come from.
42621297,DoubleHunter,"[Yeah, about that.] (https://youtu.be/dgsDdJy2-0g?t=3m24s)"
40015889,DoubleHunter,"What else in Episode 10 would blow the fans' minds? The Walk of Shame? Nah. Kevan and Pycelle's assassination? Probably not. Arya and/or Dany sailing back to Westeros? Not really. LS? I think that ship has sailed. The only thing other than ""For the Watch"" that would blow the fans' minds would be something crazy happening in Winterfell like Stannis being killed."
32218567,DoubleHunter,"If Roose wins:

1. Take the North. 2. Marry Sansa and declare her the Queen of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale. 3. Kill the Lannisters.

If Stannis wins:

1. Swear fealty to Stannis. ?. Maybe ask to be married to Sansa. 2. Attack the Lannisters. 3. Get rid of Stannis (and Shireen). 4. Declare Sansa as the Queen of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale."
47315652,DoubleHunter,"Some reasons why the drop in ratings might be happening this season:

- The first 4 episodes leaking online

- Mother's day

- Memorial day

- The abysmal marketing

- People getting too used to the show having a huge event every other episode from last year

- The continuing increase in online piracy

- Some people quitting the show after Episode 6

- People not liking Tyrion not being the biggest character of the show

- People failing to see the quality in the Wall storyline because they automatically assume that it sucks

- People failing to find Cersei entertaining"
36766269,DoubleHunter,So Syrio beat Sansa? Huh.
47279968,DoubleHunter,If it's not him then I'll be shocked. The real mystery is the actor. Brian Cox? Mark Strong? Ian McShane? There are so many good choices.
39825445,DoubleHunter,"I thought this thread was ""[ALL SPOILERS]""."
24198951,DoubleHunter,Theon and Sam are odd picks.
36916389,DoubleHunter,"Usually when I try to keep something in my mind I forget it, and when I try to forget something it stays in my mind."
43000788,DoubleHunter,"What's funny is that I live even further north than Montreal, and I'm not sure if I've ever been in a snow storm that's that bad."
38622057,DoubleHunter,And wear a helmet!
38157391,DoubleHunter,Precisely.
49332490,DoubleHunter,My two biggest complaints are that ultimately the fate of Slaver's Bay is irrelevant and that there are pretty much no interesting Essosi characters.
41144361,DoubleHunter,To me at least flaws are what make characters interesting.
41059343,DoubleHunter,Over the High Sparrow and the Tyrells? Hell yeah.
41707908,DoubleHunter,"It's a shame, because Jaime's aFfC Riverlands arc was gold."
41027342,DoubleHunter,"The evidence of Littlefinger looking after her is even more so. Catelyn believes that Littlefinger betrayed Ned. How is Littlefinger exactly protecting her by giving her to the Boltons, and why isn't he there? How does Catelyn even know that Littlefinger is ""protecting"" her?"
42352515,DoubleHunter,Other than two of the three biggest characters in the show meeting for the first time?
42525479,DoubleHunter,You don't want to piss off the church. Even in medieval Europe the greatest of kings bowed to the Pope.
38460419,DoubleHunter,"Jeez, so that's going to be Sora's new voice."
41162726,DoubleHunter,What did AudioSly spoil?
16542250,DoubleHunter,"Sure, but IMO ""The Winds of Winter"" is a lot more ominous and actually fits multiple storylines instead of just one. The connection with Episode 9's title is also nice.

I'm also not 100% certain that ""For the Watch"" is in the finale."
35161581,DoubleHunter,Yup.
43467353,DoubleHunter,Did she?
40305845,DoubleHunter,"So is Jon actually going to be stabbed in Episode 9?

What decision? How to execute Theon? What to do with Brienne?"
42686560,DoubleHunter,"You're going to hate me for saying this, but Margaery's ""Get out you hateful bitch!"" line also sounded forced to me."
43403372,DoubleHunter,For powah!
42556294,DoubleHunter,That would be all fine and good if her every other line didn't feel forced.
40283147,DoubleHunter,Can't go anywhere without the Witcher 3 being hyped it seems. Hurry up mail service!
36984266,DoubleHunter,"Jorah can make it noticeable. And even if the opponent thinks that he could win, there's a big likelyhood that he can still catch the disease during the fight."
31392494,DoubleHunter,Areo was actually pretty cool. The move he showed Jaime was easily the best choreographed move in the episode.
36627683,DoubleHunter,For you.
37859911,DoubleHunter,That's certainly the post-Dance Targ law. I'm not sure what type of succession law is used after Robert takes the throne in the books.
34599949,DoubleHunter,"The biggest obstacle is still Theon's fear of Ramsay.

Ramsay would also probably hear him picking up a chair. A candle to the hair though... I hadn't considered him using fire."
40125674,DoubleHunter,Episode 10 will be packed as it is. Will there be enough time for a clash between Stannis and the Boltons?
40069385,DoubleHunter,In the finale? Hasn't it been all but confirmed that the pit scene will happen in Episode 9?
43384948,DoubleHunter,Must have been a tough category to pick from.
40141705,DoubleHunter,"If it's actually going to take place next season I wonder why they're hyping it so much. But then again, they did the same thing with the Purple Wedding."
36571048,DoubleHunter,"Spread the word, darlin'. Stannis back."
34334095,DoubleHunter,"The third season of Breaking Bad was one of the slowest seasons of TV I've ever seen, but it was still good."
36690658,DoubleHunter,"I heard rumors that the guy who was on his stomach is ""a godless man"" or something like that."
45255225,DoubleHunter,Somebody play the Jeopardy music.
36205980,DoubleHunter,She didn't fly so good.
42836595,DoubleHunter,"I guess it was something about a ""training arc"" not being interesting TV."
38714456,DoubleHunter,I'd be down for a disfigured Loras. The only question is: how would he be disfigured?
24378466,DoubleHunter,"And he started the series as a bastard. Also, Littlefinger used Lysa's family name to become the acting lord of the Vale."
36139821,DoubleHunter,Did you also see Trystane's sword? Bronn was right about the Dornish being crazy.
36613911,DoubleHunter,"Stannis vs Ramsay. Maimerbowl, get hype!"
43243060,DoubleHunter,"People usually really hate the awful things in GoT that are relevant in the real world. This is why an average GoT viewer dislikes stuff like zealots and rape, but in turn loves stuff like duels to the death."
43218512,DoubleHunter,Tell that to Balon Greyjoy.
42613838,DoubleHunter,No worries.
36585252,DoubleHunter,"Syrio: What do we say to the god of death?

Obara: I am Obara Sand, daughter of Oberyn Martell!"
39788830,DoubleHunter,At this point I might even bet money on him appearing this season.
46196380,DoubleHunter,"The Greyjoy theme, the Stark theme, the Stannis theme and the Rains of Castamere are all great. If Dany's theme counts as the Targaryen theme then that's my favorite."
42509243,DoubleHunter,"I'd go with ""Look, the pie!"". So forced."
38641351,DoubleHunter,Unsullied = people who only watch the show.
24485711,DoubleHunter,Cool. I'm just genuinely surprised because I constantly see people calling Theon one of the best written character in the series.
42602353,DoubleHunter,"""an unexpected ally arrived in the form of Stannis Baratheon, his army, and **the Mother of Smoke Babies**, Melisandre."" Lol."
38743963,DoubleHunter,"The showrunners keep saying that they aim to finish the show in 7 seasons, but they've also mentioned 8 as a possibility. HBO wants it to go on for 10 or more seasons, but also say that they will ultimately let the writers decide.

I'd be down for 8 seasons or at least an extended 7th season to wrap the show up."
43451908,DoubleHunter,Just wanted to know if you thought that Stannis losing to the Boltons was a likely option. Stannis and the Boltons all dying is also a possibility though.
42402577,DoubleHunter,To draw parallels between characters I guess.
42926698,DoubleHunter,No. After the Arryns the Tyrells are my least favorite Great House.
36674045,DoubleHunter,[Get more hype] (http://www.memeslanding.com/Game+Of+Thrones+Funny+Pics/Stannis-hands-out-some-tips/590)
36401637,DoubleHunter,"Yeah, claiming that GoT's showrunners are sexist towards women is like claiming that the Wire's showrunners are racist towards Whites."
36478813,DoubleHunter,Thanks. I'll edit it.
50281075,DoubleHunter,I think that's fan made.
42828403,DoubleHunter,I'm sure that he'll return and most likely become Hand.
34968196,DoubleHunter,"The actors grow more expensive every year, and the kid actors literally grow. The core crew probably also wants to move on in their lifes, and can you blame them? They've been making the show since 2007 or something."
42626344,DoubleHunter,"Tyrion: You killed your first man before you were twelve.

Bronn: It was a woman."
41017535,DoubleHunter,"I doubt that LS would knows about her killing them, and even if she did it's highly doubtful that she'd believe that the Hound was protecting Arya. So the only decent ""evidence"" of her betrayal would be the sword."
41118692,DoubleHunter,"He wrote to Barristan about Jorah being a former spy, which led to Dany banishing Jorah."
42809673,DoubleHunter,The Vale.
43024035,DoubleHunter,I miss the knucklebones sack now.
42759180,DoubleHunter,"&gt;Her entire arc just feels completely pointless, or at least directionless.

Couldn't you say that about every character?"

41245295,DoubleHunter,"I love Olenna, but Margaery and Loras are boring and often times annoying."
42544359,DoubleHunter,"This is pure speculation, but if Doran is in Team Dany he might hold Jaime in captivity for her. Aside from Stannis, Jaime is the biggest ""Usurper's Dog"" left."
36902660,DoubleHunter,"I want to see him use the ""touch of death""."
33271771,DoubleHunter,It's certainly more interesting than her Qarth arc or her relatively easy conquest of Slaver's Bay. Emilia Clarke's performance is also better than in previous seasons.
43459560,DoubleHunter,There's been very little of Pycelle in this season. Perhaps it would be smarter to keep him around?
32228216,DoubleHunter,Ramsay with blood on his face. Please give me a Stannis vs Ramsay duel.
46462266,DoubleHunter,"Man, almost everything points to something horrible happening to the Baratheons this season. If Stannis and Shireen both die, fuuuck."
42728710,DoubleHunter,This has been going on since Season 1. It's the money Lebowski.
41722050,DoubleHunter,The hype way!
39814975,DoubleHunter,"Jon will probably be stabbed in Episode 10 then.

I still don't see how they plan to deal with Kit Harrington doing Season 6 not leaking."
42829196,DoubleHunter,It's been confirmed that Bran's not in this season.
36018112,DoubleHunter,I don't even...
49339179,DoubleHunter,At least 4 major characters will die.
44493957,DoubleHunter,And some people are actually saying that Bryan Cogman's a bad writer.
36110889,DoubleHunter,"Or when Drogo raped Dany. Or when Sansa was almost raped by the mob. Or when Theon was almost raped by Ramsay's minions.

The main reason seems to be that people are more invested in Sansa than the previous rape victims."
41561298,DoubleHunter,"Game of Thrones has a bunch of great directors, but Neil Marshall puts them all to shame."
38534141,DoubleHunter,In the books Renly declared himself king before Stannis.
44366795,DoubleHunter,"That would indeed be interesting. Would the child actually be a bastard, since Ramsay is kind of an unlegitimized bastard? I guess Stannis could legitimize Ramsay before executing him."
38832596,DoubleHunter,"And I was here thinking that they weren't doing the Ironborn storyline.

Seriously though, Benjen might actually replace Howland Reed in the show."
32189147,DoubleHunter,Maybe she'll just receive a certain punishment. A tongue for lying or something like that.
36125603,DoubleHunter,Jaime in the Riverlands is gold. The Greyjoys are entertaining. One Brienne chapter has one of the best monologues of the entire series.
37865387,DoubleHunter,Perhaps.
43331841,DoubleHunter,"With Ygritte and Mance dead, he's pretty much the only Wildling that the viewers like. Unless of course we meet some decent new Wildlings at Hardhome."
47942430,DoubleHunter,"IIRC he actually dismissed that in another interview.

Also, work is work, and GoT would definitely make him more famous again."
43283431,DoubleHunter,They have no idea what's going on outside Winterfell though. Brienne could have a few dozen men-at-arms with her that could climb over the walls at night and rescue Sansa.
42691989,DoubleHunter,He was probably just drinking blood.
42644379,DoubleHunter,[Huh?] (https://youtu.be/kEUFBtxzPww?t=25s)
32232647,DoubleHunter,"It's funny that in the books neither Ramsay or Stannis are exceptional warriors. However, in the show both Stannis and Ramsay are probably in the top 5 considering episode 209 and episode 406."
43362334,DoubleHunter,Or for Stannis himself... please god no.
16531170,DoubleHunter,"I dunno. I think it should be used in the episode where winter actually begins, which is probably going to be S5E10."
24193274,DoubleHunter,Keep in mind that Cersei believes that Sansa played a part in Joffrey's murder.
34981017,DoubleHunter,Olenna's pizza probably has the double figs.
36132389,DoubleHunter,"The Wall: A+

Winterfell: A

King's Landing: A-

Tyrion's roadtrip: B+

Braavos: B

Meereen: B-

Dorne: C-"
36215985,DoubleHunter,"This is great, and so was the Jaime one.

Someone should make one about the Faith Militant."
36969248,DoubleHunter,"Yeah, but the opponent would probably get pretty scared if he noticed that Jorah was trying to infect him with Greyscale."
39989639,DoubleHunter,It would also be harder to promote the new season without one of their three leads.
37838914,DoubleHunter,"The Lannisters probably consider Stannis to be disinherited.

The show's succession laws are apparently different compared to the books. Pretty much nobody refers to Cersei as Tywin's potential heir, Jaime thinks that if Tyrion dies and he remains in the Kingsguard that Casterly Rock would not go to Cersei and her kids, Renly says that he's fourth in the line of succession..."
44372231,DoubleHunter,By Tommen. Stannis certainly will not see that as a valid legitimization.
43391533,DoubleHunter,"[Put that sword down, NOW!] (http://images6.fanpop.com/image/polls/1312000/1312058_1386177921856_full.png)"

39651836,DoubleHunter,"Stannis vs Ramsay will possibly happen in Episode 9, and then Stannis vs Roose could happen in Episode 10."
24415846,DoubleHunter,"Not really, Roose could have easily just send Ramsay to the Wall and fathered a new son.

If we go by the books:

Ramsay had to attack the Hornwood lands, starve Lady Hornwood, infiltrate Winterfell, gain Theon's trust, defeat Ser Rodrik's larger army, burn Winterfell, torture Theon for the period of months and flay a bunch of Ironborn to get where he now.

If we go by the show:

Ramsay had to torture Theon for the period of months, fight a group of Ironborn and flay a bunch of Ironborn to get where he is now."
50070362,DoubleHunter,You might be more right than you know. I think it's very likely that all the major female characters will survive.
42319426,DoubleHunter,"- It might be the first time in the books where we see Jaime be fully in charge of the situation.

- The people Jaime needs to deal with and the ways he deals with them are interesting. These people include Lancel, the Mountain's men, the Freys, Edmure and the Blackfish.

- Jaime swore a vow to never fight against the Starks or Tullys to Catelyn, and he actually keeps it. This leads to Jaime having to use diplomacy, and he's actually surprisingly good at it.

- We meet Jaime's aunt Genna, who is like the Lannister version of Olenna. She also gives us new insight into Tywin's character.

- Some readers might have seen the Lannisters and their bannermen as the ""villains"" for the first three books, but Jaime's arc in the Riverlands really shows that most of the Westermen are really just decent folk.

- Jaime has been a great fighter for most of his life and has never cared about court intrigue, so it's great to see him find new things that he can excel at now that his hand is gone."
33013492,DoubleHunter,The Dornish subplot could certainly use a flamethrower guitar.
43456571,DoubleHunter,Viserys. He really was our first big character death.
37062688,DoubleHunter,In Stannis Baratheon's Whacky Northern Adventure Episode 6: The Tarth Strikes Back! Rated PG-13.
38245231,DoubleHunter,"If you ask me, the only real drop in quality the show's had was Season 2. After that it has just been going up.

This season is pretty similar to Season 3. 

- King's Landing is not the most important location
 
- We have a new fan favorite who most people didn't like in previous seasons
 
- One storyline is somewhat build around Sansa's wedding

- Tyrion is not the central character of the season

- Jon Snow has to work with a new faction of people

- One or two storylines will (presumably) have epic and shocking conclusions

The biggest reason why people started to love Season 3 quicker than Season 5 was probably ""Dracarys""."
16501488,DoubleHunter,"It's probably just a guess. Personally I would prefer ""The Winds of Winter"" as the title."
41490731,DoubleHunter,"Hmm. Perhaps the High Sparrow would believe him, and declare him king because all the other canditates are either infidels or abominations. Not sure if Gendry would want to be supported by radical fanatics though."
33246706,DoubleHunter,"They're mostly just following the books, so maybe your criticism should directed at GRRM?"
42558884,DoubleHunter,Because the regular sparrows don't have the dope.
39685242,DoubleHunter,Aaah. Now I get what you're saying. No worries.
42788806,DoubleHunter,"I dislike Arya's Braavos arc, the Faceless Men and Book Jaqen, and even I can't deny that Tom Wlaschiha is awesome in the role and makes the character so much better than he is in the books."
36311198,DoubleHunter,"It won't be long until the Episode 7 promo pics are released. Then we'll go back to talking about how pimp Stannis is this season, how much better Sansa looks with her auburn hair and all that good stuff."
49873176,DoubleHunter,"[A happy ending, eh?] (http://www.bustle.com/articles/86100-game-of-thrones-ramsay-bolton-vs-joffrey-7-reasons-the-north-needs-to-begin-praying-for/image/406295)

I'm not denying that the Slaver's Bay arc will have an impact on Dany's character. I just think that the place will become irrelevant after Dany leaves it for good."
41121697,DoubleHunter,They already send Jorah a royal pardon back in Season 1. I assume that the letter they send to Barristan (which was given to him by one of Varys' little birds) was a copy of that pardon.
42528727,DoubleHunter,"If those are mad decisions, then I guess 95% of the characters in GoT are mad."
37899888,DoubleHunter,"God, I wish they'd go back to the old Small Council chamber. I can see the point in Cersei holding meetings in the Tower of the Hand, because she's a Tywin wannabe and all that, but man..."
32409144,DoubleHunter,"If Stannis makes an alliance with Littlefinger something will eventually break it, for sure. Might be a good reason to bring back the Hound. He's pretty much the only person that knows about Littlefinger's betrayal of Ned who Stannis and Sansa might trust."
42612781,DoubleHunter,"To me most of Natalie Dormer's lines sound forced, so I don't really care if it fits the context or not. I just pick the line that is the most forced."
42734069,DoubleHunter,"This again?

What do you want? Sansa having some BS plot about seducing a blonde hunk while she's constantly being manipulated Littlefinger? I'd take Sansa in Winterfell any day over that snoozefest."
36543302,DoubleHunter,"Damn, I forgot about that one. Time for an edit. Well done sir/miss."
32153908,DoubleHunter,"Like with most Game of Thrones characters, I like him as a character. If I'd hate every character in GoT that had done some unethical or immoral things, the list of my favorite characters would be very short."
24507397,DoubleHunter,The wine was probably not lethal. It did get Drogo moving after all.
32914904,DoubleHunter,"I've learned to love Ben. However, I'm starting to dislike Matt more and more."
42377117,DoubleHunter,For the lols?
41274726,DoubleHunter,"By hand. They might have had a copy made back in Season 1, just in case the other one went missing. Or they made a new copy. Pycelle has probably gotten pretty good at forging Robert's signature over the years."
33085763,DoubleHunter,"The show is very inconsistent with troop numbers. In a  conversation Littlefinger had with Tywin he said that the Starks and the Lannisters had larger armies than the Tyrells. But Renly still had 100 000 men and Stannis' army at the Blackwater had to be around the size of 20 000 men because he came to King's Landing with 200 ships. So more than 80 000 of Renly's men were from the Reach, which is a much larger force than either the Lannisters or the Starks can muster."
40316208,DoubleHunter,Nice.
46452434,DoubleHunter,I don't think they do. It's just a nickname.
41060090,DoubleHunter,Could be a cut scene.
24493013,DoubleHunter,Yeah the increasing lack of cool and badass fighters is troubling.
43290496,DoubleHunter,"It certainly makes her more relatable, but it still doesn't bring the child back. If the deed is gruesome does the motive still matter?"
48862344,DoubleHunter,"It can still happen. I remember the Purple Wedding episode's synopsis being something like: ""Joffrey and Margaery have breakfast."""
43311164,DoubleHunter,Non-lethal poison.
42776874,DoubleHunter,"I recently talked about this on an other thread, so I'll keep this short. She's lost at playing the character. Margaery's genuine moments seem forced and she's transparent as hell in her moments of manipulation."
38865724,DoubleHunter,And don't drink before the fight!
36881873,DoubleHunter,That's literally the worse thing that could happen. Oh wait... What if Ramsay kidnaps Shireen?
31200494,DoubleHunter,"And Littlefinger did most of his work with Lannister and Arryn/Tully ""papers"".

Both Ramsay and Littlefinger started near the bottom, and have gotten very by using other people and their family names wheter it's Stark, Lannister, Greyjoy, Arryn or Baratheon."
36701390,DoubleHunter,They're certainly no ravens.
48253028,DoubleHunter,"I think GRRM himself has said that there's a lot of Tiberius in Stannis. Particularly Tiberius as he was portrayed in I, Claudius."
41701276,DoubleHunter,He was taken prisoner by the Freys.
39512233,DoubleHunter,GRRM is literally the only person I've ever heard pronouncing them like that.

36560446,DoubleHunter,Also the inn fight. D&amp;D are surprisingly good at directing.
42906625,DoubleHunter,"Yeah, like Jorah stealing the boat. I couldn't almost see anything in that scene."
44398472,DoubleHunter,"Yeah, I'll edit it into ""some people"". A poor choice of words on my part."
42522144,DoubleHunter,Maybe he meant Robin.
41166521,DoubleHunter,[S2][S3] is what I see.
41609904,DoubleHunter,I dunno. Roose would probably put Sansa through some pretty horrible training if this happened.
33055948,DoubleHunter,You and me both.

Some houses in the North like the Manderlys, the Mountain clans and the Dustins still have most of their strength left, while others like the Mormonts only have something like a few hundred men left."
42600705,DoubleHunter,Inspect her if you must.
34148895,DoubleHunter,"Also, the idea that Sansa is becoming a master plotter is just BS. She's a freaking amateur, and lying about Lysa's fate doesn't change that. Sansa's strength has always been her endurance.

It would be like people complaining about Ned's fate. ""Ned for once tried to plot and in return he was thrown into a cell. HBO is not allowing Ned to be developed into a strong manipulator. The writers clearly don't know how to write male characters."" Why are people who were fine with Ned's fate complaining about Sansa's rape? "" Sansa so far is not raped in the books and the rape of an innocent girl is THE worst crime a person can commit."""
41119880,DoubleHunter,How is she weak exactly?
42815965,DoubleHunter,The Tullys are more interesting than the Starks.
36950682,DoubleHunter,"Fuck. The kidnapping of little children has happened before on HBO in shows like Oz and Rome, and it's usually the most disturbing stuff for me to watch, so I really hope that D&amp;D aren't going to try and ""top"" their fellow HBO showrunners if they're doing a kidnapping plot."

41537264,DoubleHunter,"How about that Yara action? Pretty sweet, right?"
39506446,DoubleHunter,"Yup. 

The biggest reason is that books 4 and 5 move at a snail's pace. Plus, they had already used certain material from them in Season 4 like Theon taking Moat Cailin and the Lords of the Vale questioning Littlefinger."
42874199,DoubleHunter,A Shadow Pinocchio?

34128132,DoubleHunter,"I'm not sure that the lords of the Vale would attack Stannis. They supported Robert during his rebellion, and apparently like the Starks and hate the Lannisters. Stannis is Robert's brother and has just restored House Stark, brought down House Bolton and is fighting against the Lannisters. Also as a bonus, he has a letter that proves that Ned supported him, and Yohn Royce seemingly was Ned's buddy. Why would they fight against him? Hell, Sansa's probably pissed at Littlefinger for giving her to Ramsay, and she could reveal the truth about Lysa's death to the lords of the Vale."

39760153,DoubleHunter,"It's a good season, but not as good as Season 1.

Blackwater is my favorite episode of the whole show, Theon is my second favorite character and his arc was done perfectly and Tyrion as Hand was great. However, Season 2 still had stuff like Robb and Talisa and Dany's Qarth arc. And there are only two episodes in Season 2 that I truly love."

42972871,SawRub,They couldn't handle how cool she was.
1817206,SawRub,"I can imagine starting at the Tourney at Harrenhal. First episode establishes the Stark kids: Brandon, Eddard, Lyanna, Benjen. Robert Baratheon. EvenHowland Reed perhaps. Show young Oberyn Martell, Jon Arryn. Establish the most badass Kingsguard ever including Ser Arthur Dayne, younger Barristan Selmy, Oswell Whent.

While these people are established, halfway through royal music plays and in comes Rhaegar Targaryen, and Elia Martell. He's stealing all the attention. Maybe even show Robert slightly annoyed. Lyanna crying at his poem, Benjen teasing her, etc.

Within two episodes we can deal with the Tourney at Harrenhal, with the second episode perhaps ending with Rhaegar passing over his own wife and naming Lyanna the Queen of Love and Beauty, and the crowd going silent.

Could even be done in one episode if they are pressed for time.

Next few episodes: 

We get the kidnapping, Brandon and his Northmen going to King's Landing, fathers getting called, all dying.

Jon Arryn being asked to send Ned and Bobby B, him calling banners.

Ned and Robert sneaking into their lands and raising their banners in rebellion.

Robert defeating three separate armies in a day at Summerhall.

They could skip Ashford if they wanted to. Stannis starts protecting Storm's End from a siege that will last a year.

Battle of the Bells, Robert almost taken out, reinforcements from Ned, Ned marries Cat, Jon Arryn marries Lysa.

Episode 8 or 9, perhaps, Battle of the Trident, Rhaegar dies.

Last episode or two has the Sack of King's Landing, the Mountain inspiring Oberyn Martell's public accusations of nearly two decades later, then Ned arriving and seeing Jaime on the throne, presenting of dead Targ babies, Ned going South to lift the Storm's End siege.

Final scene will be Tower of Joy, but could be interspersed with Daenerys Targaryen being born or spirited away as Stannis' ships approach Dragonstone, if the show wants to push the Jon/Dany destiny children thing."

If it was the last resort at the end of the season and he said no, that would be one thing, but he said no too early, which means she's gonna ask again when times are more dire."
2503843,SawRub,"They did though, both the Blackfish and Robb Stark both chided him hard about it.

In fact, what they should have emphasized was that Robb didn't tell him the plan. Edmure was Lord of the Riverlands and was protecting his Riverlands because Robb didn't tell him about the trap. He saw an opportunity to fight off Tywin, and he took it."

4565053,SawRub,"Yeah despite everything Viserys did, I pitied him when he went out. It was quite sad really. The actor really nailed the scene.

He was a boy with a baby sister he dragged with him and clothed and fed, while begging for support. At one point he even had to sell his mother's crown. The Targ madness took hold though and he went a bit bad, but compared to crazy Targs he wasn't even that bad."

41706015,SawRub,I think that guy could do a good Robb Stark as well. Some of his pronunciation was just like Robb's.

And these sisters she's so close with, and this mother figure, they've never heard this story before? This is literally the first time she got an opportunity to tell them this story?"

1733025,SawRub,"And seeing as the show has become so mainstream, this time they'll be able to get even bigger actors, who will even commit. Not just because the show is so popular, but also TV itself is becoming popular for movie stars as proven by True Detective. And if Robert's Rebellion is a miniseries too, it's not as long a commitment.

They could even do a series of Dunk and Egg episodes, with about 2 episodes per novella."

15709368,SawRub,When capitalized like that I imagined WEEP being VEEP but a drama.
20016400,SawRub,"Do you not see the hate against Stannis everywhere else? It's been going on for years. This is the only place where he gets a bit of support, and it's with the full knowledge that he's probably going to die soon at some point. Stannis has been getting hate for years. I literally saw people wanting him killed because he was ""old and gross"". The fandom is still a Dany-majority.

Also part of the problem is that in the books all the characters are quite flawed and there are no perfect characters. In previous seasons, they had made Daenerys more good, and Stannis more bad, which made people want to try to balance it in the fandom.

Besides, this is actually a fun direction to go for Daenerys. I'm more invested in her now. In the books at this point her story was a bit boring.

Just because people are making jokes at Dany's expense doesn't mean *everyone* hates her. She's by far the most popular character, and it's just often fun to poke fun at the person on top. I still root for her to succeed."

Walder Frey offered Roose the bride's weight in silver as dowry if he married one of his daughters/granddaughters, so Roose Bolton, ever the pragmatist, chose the fattest one."

19977543,SawRub,"Only in the show. That word is not used in the books. The guy that they burnt actually tried to cut a deal with the Lannisters and give them Shireen as a hostage, and *that's* why he was punished, not for being an 'infidel'."

28873611,SawRub,"&gt; Stannis's own bannermen flocked to his younger brother

That's flat out wrong.

Stannis was Lord of Dragonstone, and he had *all* his bannermen.

Renly was Lord of Storm's End, and the Stormlands were sworn to him. Yet it was some of *his* bannermen went to Stannis instead. And after he died, even more did.

Robert gave Renly Storm's End, so Renly had about 15 years to make friends with everyone in the Stormlands."
1721327,SawRub,Mayhaps.

1723207,SawRub,Oh lol three of your comments were spaced close together and I thought they were all by different people and that Greyjoys had suddenly taken over the thread.
5148906,SawRub,I can't believe Meryn FUCKING Trant outlived the Hound.
30774321,SawRub,I don't think that's the one. The one being talked about was a private reading.
28865327,SawRub,"They were still his family. He was about ten when he was taken away from them, he still remembers them well. Of course he would choose his family. Ned Stark treated him well, but he would have killed Theon if Balon so much as lifted a finger.

I can't believe that guy got downvoted into negatives for suggesting that supporting his family, as much as it pained him, was a valid choice. We all love the Starks, but choosing one's family, even if they aren't all nice, isn't an invalid choice.

And Theon was taken because Balon declared independence from the Iron Throne, the same thing Robb did later."
15699116,SawRub,I bet she'll say something real dramatically making sure to over-enunciate each syllable.
5078280,SawRub,Barristan is the best.
42895583,SawRub,"And maybe Jorah soon if Tyrion can talk her into it, and let's face it, he probably can.

The last Targaryen ruler also had a very smart Lannister to run the kingdom."
8634456,SawRub,"He's pretty awesome, and I'd like to see him again, but the royalty potential is incredibly low, since if Stannis legitimized him, Gendry would come before him, so he wouldn't do that. He would be a competitor for Tommen, a new Daemon Blackfyre, so Cersei wouldn't let Tommen do that either.

I liked the idea of the son of a King living a normal non-royal life and not going through the fantasy trope of finding out who he is and eventually becoming King."
15715932,SawRub,"I don't know, this season has been way too good with Stannis scenes, D&amp;D might feel it's time to add a made-up creepy one instead."
30817267,SawRub,Or Stockholm Syndrome.
14347404,SawRub,"That's completely different though. Needle not actually being a very strong blade, and having to use it in non-traditional ways was actually discussed *in* the show so it is very relevant."

5604580,SawRub,"Shit, in a peaceful world if Tywin, Stannis, Randyll Tarly, Robb Stark and Roose Bolton worked together on military strategy, they could take over the world. Throw in a little Victarion Greyjoy too, especially in case Stannis does doesn't want to take command of the ships himself."
20026223,SawRub,At least you're not a Tarbeck. They died with you but they didn't even get a song out of it because their name was not a pun.

5033425,SawRub,There was a time when people confused Lancel and Loras. Now they look so different.
43167810,SawRub,"Well I mean it's only episode 7, I'm expecting the Redemption of Theon in episode 9 or 10."
42937046,SawRub,"Yes, I support Stannis, but I totally get where Loras is coming from. Not to mention, as Renly's chief backers, had Stannis won, the Tyrells would go back to being relatively political outcasts they had become because of siding against Robert in his Rebellion. And also not to mention, Stannis hasn't been fond of the Tyrells ever since they made him, his men, and their families nearly starve to death, so even if Loras and Margaery did go to him willingly, he probably wouldn't give them the good deals that the Lannisters did. They really had no reason to side with him."
30788124,SawRub,Well I'll take your word for it &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;
14393475,SawRub,How could Cersei possibly inherit the Iron Throne? She can't even use the Baratheon name!
14412791,SawRub,"True, if you were paying him, he'd be an unstoppable beast who would decimate anyone in your path. Only downside is that it could turn an entire Kingdom against your family."
15705359,SawRub,"Yeah I watched the first season and then read the books, so even while reading I pictured the show versions of a lot of things, and I think that may have made the transitions a lot smoother. I got in early enough to not have the Red Wedding and other cool stuff spoiled for me by the show, and late enough to not have the casting, design and stylistic choices of the show be too jarring."
42905937,SawRub,"I remember that scene where Simon was under the influence of someone's power, and he told her that he wanted to ""piss on your tits"".

I'd like to imagine even Ramsay going like, ""Ew that's gross, man."""
8638327,SawRub,"About that House Targaryen description, they just say mention that it was a rebellion and nothing else, and without context it makes it look like the Targaryens were the wronged party."

14409939,SawRub,"That was the best, and Pycelle staying Grand Maester was an understated good one too."
43183693,SawRub,"Yeah and apart from the fact that Viserys taught her that Starks and Lannisters were the Usurper's dogs, the last two Lannisters her family dealt with actually were not good to them at all.

Jaime Lannister killed her father, and Tywin Lannister who was once loyal to her father, tricked him into opening the gates of King's Landing, and then sacked the city in Robert's name, and then had his men kill Rhaegar's wife and kids.

Should have probably opened with, ""I'm the man who killed Tywin Lannister."""
5141560,SawRub,The entire scene played like a medieval Charlie's Angels ripoff. Like a B-movie.
33991515,SawRub,"&gt; Stannis wouldn't

30760860,SawRub,You can be reddit's bizarro Unidan.

39981187,SawRub,"The third book was so amazing that anything after it would have way too much to match up to.

In book 3, the second half especially, every single chapter is absolutely amazing, just so good.

Book was so good they made two seasons out of it, and even spent a few episodes of this season tying up some plotlines from book 3."
44279799,SawRub,"In the books, Dany actually got to see a vision of what her son Rhaego and his Khalasar would have been like, and it was exactly as feared. As for the accuracy of the visions, they were pretty accurate, they even predicted the Red Wedding in book 2, but we just didn't realize because Dany, having never met Robb, didn't say his name."
6301688,SawRub,It's certainly how D&amp;D see readers who question their interpretation of Stannis.

18220799,SawRub,I guess it was a colloquialism and Stannis being a learned dude is one of the few people who say it properly.
5173332,SawRub,Well he was up against Tywin and Roose Bolton.
30809407,SawRub,"Meowth, that's right!"
30941228,SawRub,"Maybe not on the show.

18361480,SawRub,Lol I remember how mad Fox News got when they found out that D&amp;D had used George Bush's head as one of the heads on spikes next to Ned's.
14390826,SawRub,"Yeah it sounded like that scene from Scandal. Jake looked very dead dead at the end of that episode with 20 stabbings, it all fits."
31228784,SawRub,"I agree, he was definitely the nicest leader of a band of murderers and rapists."
1827202,SawRub,"Yeah Jaime wanted it to look like a clean fight because if he killed Ned, it would be much cleaner if it didn't seem like he straight up assassinated him."
1825073,SawRub,"Stannis isn't saying he killed Mance to make people fear him, he's saying he didn't show additional mercy so that people feared him and didn't have reason to think he was weak. A comparable situation would be if Ned allowed Gared to rot in a jail cell, still a punishment, but one that could make his subjects think he was weak."
15723336,SawRub,"And as a bonus, we had Wendel Manderly on the show too, he had a huge Manderly sigil on his chest when he attended the Red Wedding."
39973826,SawRub,"Not to mention, Tansy, which moon tea is also referred to as, was actually mentioned in the previous episode in another context."
14344718,SawRub,"I literally don't know a single person who has taken longer than five days.

25888833,SawRub,It's great that you update it based on the responses. Good job!
30743168,SawRub,"Just in case people genuinely wanted to know, it's Red Wedding. We see Tywin writing letters all season and we find out later he was in correspondence with Walder Frey and Roose Bolton."
19990781,SawRub,"For power? Renly was a traitor who was trying to steal a throne without cause! Renly was going to destroy Stannis in the morning, as well as thousands of his men. Stannis killed one man to save thousands, even though it pained him. Stannis even offered Renly to name him his heir, but the Tyrells had gotten in his ear by then.

As for Mance, do you realize how ridiculous Mance was being? Mance sent people to destroy entire villages and kill innocent people, and was planning to invade and not follow the local laws. The right course of action was to kill him. Despite that Stannis offered him a chance to live, and all he had to do was kneel. Kneel, and all his vast crimes would be forgiven. Mance was even a deserter of the Night's Watch, and even Ned Stark beheaded a guy for that, even though that guy was just trying to escape the White Walkers."
14361872,SawRub,"I know the image you mean, and that was completely fan made.

Besides, they'd never make a promo image of what would be a big reveal."

34646066,SawRub,"""Forgive me, Stannis, but for me, you've been dead for centuries."""
31106570,SawRub,"It's like how many people were against the atom bomb, but still wanted America to win against the Japanese. Melisandre is just our ace in the hole."
41701387,SawRub,Yeah Stannis sees Littlefinger as the personification of the corruption of King's Landing.
43185137,SawRub,It was the books I think that she refers to Tywin and Ned as the Usurper's dogs. I was so mad in that moment because this was the first time someone spoke negatively about Ned.
25871866,SawRub,"Those two were set pieces for the season, so they practiced months for it. The regular short fight scenes tend to be underwhelming, while on other shows they do even the short scenes really well.

Maybe they are going for realism or something, saying that real fight scenes aren't exciting, they are just brutal. Still though, there's a lot more excitement when watching Arrow or the original Black Canary do melee combat, which often even makes up for bad plot lines."
1839154,SawRub,"&gt;Arya is obviously skilled at letting go

She's the tomboyish and wilder younger sister of a more traditional prim and proper older sister who escaped the city, went somewhere else and made a castle in the snow.

I'm sure she knows how to: let it go."
14363385,SawRub,It's a joke. There are many joke theories. This is one of them.
30892087,SawRub,Reek don't got this. Maybe Theon will.
5161069,SawRub,What does the extra sweet moment between Stannis and Shireen mean for them then?!!
6262142,SawRub,"And once Stannis died, and say there were people who wanted Shireen to be Queen, Renly could have arranged a match for her with one of the Tyrell boys eventually.

He could have had the Iron Throne on a silver platter."
43177377,SawRub,"Nah man it was tacky, like a starter whorehouse."
30898134,SawRub,"A tart, even."
6257554,SawRub,You've done us proud.

43190155,SawRub,"I think the thing is that in this scene, they actually seemed competent in their skillset. And that definitely was one of their skills."
18266238,SawRub,"The last time the Mountain went up against Ser Loras, someone intervened on Loras' behalf. Hype?"
18284098,SawRub,Well his last Maester died trying to kill Melisandre so there's a vacancy.
30970922,SawRub,I think they literally did.
14373449,SawRub,"Yup.

When a new book hasn't been out in a while, people discuss them more and more and when they run out of things to discuss, come up with theories ranging from stupid to great, and all of them very detailed and meticulously written. This was more of a parody of those, a completely absurd theory, but with the same level of meticulous detail as the actual theories. It was so ridiculous, and people appreciated the level of work and commitment to it, that we upvoted it to the top and it spread from there as the ultimate joke theory of the community.

Some people might believe it of course, but definitely nothing close to R+L."
6606592,SawRub,"I wish he wasn't so duty bound though. Like if Dany came over with her dragons, I'd rather he agree to be her Master of Ships than burn in a battle against her, even though I know he wouldn't do that because he is the rightful King and stuff."
6303311,SawRub,This season they are making more like the book Stannis than the creepy weird Stannis they had in previous seasons. Everything since he came to Wall at the end of last season has been on point.
42943207,SawRub,Just added the link in case anyone wanted to remember it.
43472344,SawRub,"Well the US should stop taking them from the wild then!

5025595,SawRub,Will Mace have an 'accident'?
30895152,SawRub,Honestly I liked him more for it.
5134641,SawRub,I felt like a dad.
18264734,SawRub,Ellaria already fills that role.
33979609,SawRub,"King Rickon the Wild, as the singers call him in the future."
18255743,SawRub,I think he noticed it too late and now he can't. Like the zombie virus thing on TWD.
18499514,SawRub,Like the opposite of Batman.
50189436,SawRub,"Reminds me of the last line of his drop the mic speech to [TWOW](/b ""Theon. ""Tell me, turncloak, what battles has the Bastard of Bolton ever won that I should fear him?"""")"
30783383,SawRub,"Oh I wasn't disagreeing with you, just making an additional point as it appeared in my head."
19981269,SawRub,Stannis wouldn't apologize.
19997077,SawRub,Like Batman.
42912089,SawRub,"Yeah it reminds me of his fight scene in season 1, where the whole season the Dothraki warriors are doubtful of his armor since they claim it slows him down, and at the end of the season he uses his armor effectively to defeat one of Drogo's bloodriders. A true Westerosi knight that one.

6296565,SawRub,"Them no-good Florents, I tell ya."
18277117,SawRub,"Lol that was a tournament joust, not an actual fight.

Besides, by *hype* I was referring to a fan-speculated potential upcoming event."
43481791,SawRub,"On the show it's technically meant to be a year each season, partially to make up for all young actors growing up and looking older, but it's not very consistent. Gilly's baby is still a baby."
15708000,SawRub,And then he does too.
30906196,SawRub,"I thought she'd be like, ""Yo hold up, I know this chick."""
5079568,SawRub,Hizdahr doesn't sound like Tyrion in this episode.
1830905,SawRub,"&gt; Snow is obviously Ned Stark ultimate form.

I think that's why Stannis has a boner for him. He admired Ned Stark, but knew how he was weak. He sees Jon Snow as not only admirable like his father, but also strategically good. The kind of man Stannis would like to have on his side."
18254912,SawRub,Hence proved.
15710868,SawRub,They were three references to the whole thing in the last episode alone.
25906041,SawRub,Are we dancer?
30732063,SawRub,And another thing is that Theon's face acting has always been on point since the beginning.
43010943,SawRub,They hate us 'cause they Aenys.
15720242,SawRub,I hope she can postpone her agenda till after the war. Sansa is in the clutches of the Boltons and Stannis is the man who might be able to stop them.
6291324,SawRub,"I think part of it is probably because of the fact that the showrunners absolutely mangled his character in previous seasons. He's better in the books.

And it's made more clearly that he's not under her spell and she's not controlling him. Even if she wants to do small things, he makes her give proof first. He's also funnier in the books.

As for what he's done?

In Robert's Rebellion, he held Storm's End against the entire might of the Tyrell army for a year nearly starving to death. Had he not done that, the very large Tyrell army would have been able to go north and help the Targaryens and could have turned the tide. Immediately after the war as everyone else were celebrating, Robert sent Stannis to instead capture Dragonstone, which he also did.

The Ironborn are known for one thing primarily, their naval prowess. Victarion Greyjoy commanded the Iron Fleet during the Greyjoy Rebellion, and Stannis took the Royal Fleet, caught him in a trap and smashed the Iron Fleet off Fair Isle, after which he captured the largest of the Iron Islands. With the threat of the Iron Fleet gone, Robert and his army were able to safely invade and subsequently subdue the rest of the Iron Islands.

Robert Baratheon never praised Stannis for any of this, in fact, after he captured Dragonstone, Robert actually got mad at Stannis for letting Daenerys and Viserys escape. Yet Stannis always did his duty.

In the current war, he had the smallest army, and his traitor younger brother was about to destroy it in the morning. So he used the one advantage he had, and killed one man. So instead of thousands of Baratheon soldiers dying in the morning, one man died at night, and his soldiers instead joined his army.

Despite losing most of his men at Blackwater, he didn't bow down or negotiate a surrender, but planned his next move.

When Davos told him that the Night's Watch required his help, he listened to sound advice. ""I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.""

He took all 4000 of his remaining knights and left his strategic stronghold near King's Landing and went to save the Wall from a wildlings who had already murdered entire villages. Because of his army's enforced discipline, he was able to vanquish Mance Rayder's army which was *20 times* larger than his.

Even Littlefinger and Tyrion Lannister have called him the finest military commander in Westeros.

And you say he's done nothing?"
30767817,SawRub,Veep is awesome though! Although I started liking it more only season 3 onwards.
18247295,SawRub,There was no connection. This never happened.
30890391,SawRub,TAINTED MEAT!
1776804,SawRub,"Also apart from the scar, Tyrion is described as being quite ugly in the books."
2493403,SawRub,"And it's not even that effective because it's only in the show that they show Stannis to be 'under her spell' so to speak. In the books he looks at both Davos and Melisandre equally, and she doesn't really have a say, and everything she does seems quite transparent to everyone."
15717316,SawRub,"I think Sansa is the one person Ramsay will not hurt, at least physically, because his father has established to him her importance, and he'll listen to Roose."
1734661,SawRub,"I would go back and do a reread of her chapters, but if I look back I am lost."

42944428,SawRub,I can see Cersei saying this about Margaery in that bitchface expression we know and love/hate.
6249508,SawRub,"I think it's just a line the writer used to get Jaime and Bronn caught, might not be much else to it."

18371014,SawRub,HAR!

5138048,SawRub,"More or less. Must be a thing with Tyrell men.

I'm pretty sure Mace's dad died because he rode off a mountain cliff while basically chasing a bird."
18246589,SawRub,I always took it like the PHP we use is PHP Hypertext Processor and the PHP in *that* stands for Personal Home Page.
28889309,SawRub,"Lol and they must have spent a lot of time digging a hole to bury most of him in. Like, why? If they were torturing the information out of him, then that's one thing, but they said he volunteered the information, then what's the point of burying him there? Lol."
42909018,SawRub,One of my favorite all time gifs just because it's so unexpected and random.
1728805,SawRub,"The books are spaces so far apart that after a while, people run out of legitimate things to discuss, and start coming up with more and more outlandish theories. /r/asoiaf celebrates those theories, especially if they happen to contain even 10-20% of somewhat plausible evidence.

Most people do understand that it's completely ridiculous, but it's fun to participate nevertheless."
25858525,SawRub,"When a casting rumor leaked, I was hoping if not him, we could have had the Greatjon instead, but they're saying it was a mistaken tweet."
4573684,SawRub,They used the same music for all three.
43032180,SawRub,"Even on the show, she is RESISTANT, not IMMUNE."
30896984,SawRub,"Yeah book Loras is like a younger Jaime from a more normal family, and a relatively normal childhood."
43485938,SawRub,You missed a chance to say 'oh wow' instead of 'holy fuck'.
5107501,SawRub,What Westboro actually hates also applies here too.
42897657,SawRub,"She basically has Sansa's dream life, living in a nice warm place, about to be married to a gallant young man."
42900885,SawRub,Obara is one of the three daughters. His girlfriend was named Ellaria.
14563802,SawRub,"Figured out who she reminded me of. [This actress](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2201055/) who played the daughter on Lie To Me and more recently, Brooke, the girlfriend of 'Rat', on Sons of Anarchy."
20138620,SawRub,"But you're generalizing all people together. You're clubbing all Stannis fans into the anti-Dany group. I like them both. In fact, I only started supporting Stannis because there used to be so much hate against him. Same way Sansa became one of my favorites. A few years back, forget the rest of the internet, even right here on reddit, people wanted both Stannis and Sansa to die.

It's just recently that the anti-Dany fans have gotten more aggressive, because of the show, and since they need someone else to support, they decided to support Stannis since he was the only available alternative. But that doesn't mean supporting Stannis means one automatically hates Dany.

There are legitimate reasons to like and dislike both Daenerys and Stannis, but the militant anti-Dany and anti-Stannis people are making it seem like it's two very different sides that always hate each other. Most people don't actually hate her. There are always bad eggs that ruin it for everyone."
5113080,SawRub,"[Arrested Westeros](http://arrestedwesteros.com/)

14385469,SawRub,"Yeah since Stannis went to the Wall, Dragonstone is relatively unguarded, and taking it would be a huge victory in the eyes of the loyalists since it was his stronghold in the Narrow Sea against King's Landing."
18249291,SawRub,"That actually sounds like a line of dialogue that an adviser of Daenerys would say to her. Just add a ""your Grace"" or ""my Queen"" at the end or start of it, it works!"
41109148,TheEld,Are you talking about in the show? If so then I don't know why you would bring George into it.
21017372,TheEld,No?
19100214,TheEld,You also gotta love how everyone just stood there a few feet away from the dragons and nobody else was harmed.
17320095,TheEld,"For the same reason they aren't introducing ""Aegon"", Jon Connington, Wyman Manderly, Euron, Victarion, Penny, Reznak, Arianne, Quentyn, etc. Because they want to simplify and finish the show in seven seasons."

51523608,TheEld,Whitehills exist in the books as well.

18868478,TheEld,"He was talking to Jon, though..."
22694138,TheEld,Seriously? What was the point of changing that?
18821341,TheEld,Pretty much all of them.
27947637,TheEld,"Of course. The whole planet experiences the changing of the seasons. And yes, according to Legend when the Long Night happened thousands of years ago, Essos was also invaded by beings different cultures throughout the continent have their own names for."

25769210,TheEld,"Yes, there is. Everyone in the North knows. Cersei should know."
24484382,TheEld,At least Tyrion mentioned Thoros this season already.
22678055,TheEld,Because there hasn't been a single shot in any trailer with anything like that in it.

30163718,TheEld,Bruh
34963028,TheEld,"Yup. None of that nonsense happens in the books. As you can see by my flair, I love the Sparrows in the books. It is an outrage how they are being portrayed in the show. They don't hate gay people, they don't care about drinking, they never kill anybody, they don't care if you worship different gods than them, they don't try to shut down any brothels, they don't carve things into their foreheads, etc. All they want is to help the poor, speak out against the corrupt, and protect the weak from oppression and the horrors of a war-torn country.

30082692,TheEld,"Thank you. People are acting like this season is no different from the previous ones, but the fact that it is no longer directly based on what happened in the books is showing painfully in the coincidences, lazy plot devices, and out-of-character moments."
21538677,TheEld,Margaery doesn't really do any politicking in the books. Cersei's biggest enemy is her own paranoia.

21477304,TheEld,"There's no way Jorah should already be able to tell he has contracted the disease. That was just a bit of foolishness in the show in order to rush the revelation. It was also odd that Jorah was so concerned about the stone men touching them. The disease is generally spread through water/urine/feces. So it made no sense for Tyrion to dive into the water.

34634480,TheEld,"The DVDs of each season come with history and lore videos which are available on YouTube. Take not that while very similar, the history and lore presented in them is quite different from that in the books often.

51622475,TheEld,"[](#b "":D"")"
32731748,TheEld,That person with her in the shot from the trailer is Tommen. And Olenna has absolutely zero authority over Tyrell soldiers.
37594545,TheEld,"Because he wasn't a Targaryen supporter when Season 1 was written. He isn't one in the books, and it wasn't until recently that the writers decided to make him one in the show, hence things don't make the most sense as a whole."
33176645,TheEld,There will be seven seasons. There are 24 episodes left.
23824125,TheEld,"""Does at some point, Daenarys really come back to Westeros?""

Not yet.

""Is winter come or is still coming (one day, maybe)?""

Yes, Winter has arrived in the books.

""Arya choice to join Jaqen has some consequences or is it just a ""cool side story ?""

Arya never meets the guy who was masquerading as Jaqen again after escaping from Harrenhal. That's only in the show.

""Is there a link between all the people who believe in that ""Lord of light"" that cast more shadows than light?""

They're linked in that they belong to the same religion.

""Gendry does he matters, or was it just like a disposable character which I should skip scene with the next time I'll look previous seasons ? I thought his royal blood made him more special than just give us sex scene with that hot redhead sorceress.""

Gendry and Melisandre never meet in the books. Gendry is currently with the Brotherhood without Banners."
32608575,TheEld,What? When did you see the guy masquerading as Jaqen in the show ever slit anyone's throat?
38400716,TheEld,13
49263951,TheEld,She's 20 in the show and 16 in the books currently.
47819975,TheEld,Astapor.
20263102,TheEld,"[MAJOR SPOILERS/GEORGE'S ORIGINAL PITCH](#b ""Arya, Bran, Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys will survive the entire series."")"
39202052,TheEld,What?
35012217,TheEld,Good points. You've almost convinced me. 
21416975,TheEld,About 14 years ago. So it ended about 3 years before Robert was crowned.
44546449,TheEld,Good point. No idea. None of this is from the books so I'm just as lost as anyone else. Might be yet another inconsistency from this season.
25774925,TheEld,Westeros is a continent. The Seven Kingdoms in the kingdom.
24450414,TheEld,"Yeah, I guess so in the show. Doesn't really make sense and it doesn't work like that in the books."
21465805,TheEld,"The last Summer was indeed the longest one in recorded history, lasting about 10 years, 2 months, and 16 days. Tyrion was born in 273 AC, making him around 27 right now. We only know the precise dates of two winters since his birth. Both lasted about 2 years."
22947771,TheEld,"Only about 10% of the stuff so far in Season 5 is from the books. That isn't because they've overtaken the book, but because they're basically discounting them for their own different storylines now. Season 1 followed the books the closest, with about 80% of the material making it to the screen."
37607312,TheEld,"Yeah, and they're conspiring to put [ADWD](#b """"Aegon"""") on the throne."
34931120,TheEld,"Because the showrunners want to finish with seven seasons. They are trying to ""adapt"" A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons into about ten hours of screen time and in doing so have cut about 90% of the material from each of those books. Literally almost nothing in this season has been from the books, and it really really shows from the insane coincidences, plot armor, poor dialogue, plot holes, mischaracterizations, retcons, etc.  "
30078832,TheEld,Yes. His last chapter in A Dance with Dragons spans almost three months.
25780499,TheEld,Because he heard it from Sam who heard rumors about her from ship captains docking in Braavos. 
25081551,TheEld,"The insect was a manticore. Manticores have a poisonous sting that is fatal to humans and kills the instant it reaches the heart, unless a clotting agent is used to thicken it and delay its fatal effects. As far as the nonsense with the creepy little girl, I dunno. Apparently it had something to do with the warlocks and their magic. Nothing like that was ever in the books. A sorrowful man (the Sorrowful Men are a Qartheen group of assassins) does try to kill Dany with a manticore in the books, but it is while she is still in Qarth, where access to manticores is much easier, since they live on islands in the Jade Sea."
22616931,TheEld,"Greyscale usually only affects children, but there is another form that affects adults and is fatal. Children who contract grayscale are immune to the fatal form, however. There is also another similar fatal disease known as the grey plague that acts much faster."
43354589,TheEld,Because they were following the books in Season 1.
23977005,TheEld,"Slowest season? This is the most rushed season so far, since they're trying to condense almost half of the story of A Song of Ice and Fire so far into ten hours."
15349159,TheEld,Not really.
29411560,TheEld,He has all the motivation in the world right now. What are you talking about?
20331088,TheEld,"The book explicitly says he did.

""Westeros had seven gods at least, though Viserys had told her that some septons said the seven were only aspects of a single god, seven facets of a single crystal. That was just confusing. The red priests believed in two gods, she had heard, but two who were eternally at war. Dany liked that even less. She would not want to be eternally at war.""

-A Game of Thrones"
34751996,TheEld,"""the actor is southern""

wat"
34957450,TheEld,Just like  A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. A Storm of Swords was a climactic book. A Dream of Spring will be the second and final climactic book.
49227507,TheEld,Of course not. The Battle of Castle Black spans four chapters in A Storm of Swords and lasts for over a month. You just finished the first of those chapters. Alliser Thorne and giants are definitely part of the battle and it is thoroughly more epic and also more realistic in the book. 
44480131,TheEld,And neither of them were ever trying to put Dany on the throne.
15321255,TheEld,"You're completely off. Read the end of Jon's story in A Dance with Dragons and then come back, lol."
18879599,TheEld,Jon isn't helping Stannis do anything.
15039100,TheEld,"It was explicitly stated by Varys in Season 1. It was never ""revealed""."
31025209,TheEld,Because they make no logical sense and sometimes demand retconning material within the show itself.
20323977,TheEld,"The Targaryens followed the gods of Valyria before Aegon's Conquest, but the monarchy adopted the Faith of the Seven under Aegon in order to solidify his rule over Westeros. Ever since, every Targaryen ruler has a least payed lip service to the Faith."
32595224,TheEld,Probably not your kind of show if you thought that was boring.
48956912,TheEld,"Rhaegar+Lyanna=Daenerys and  Brandon+Ashara=Jon
"
25058970,TheEld,Not anymore. He granted the castle to Ramsay.
21558171,TheEld,Of course not.
28350269,TheEld,"It isn't. The only Lannisters there at the start are Cersei, Jaime, Lancel, and Tyrek, and then Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella if you count them.

As far as Baratheons go, Robert and his two brothers, Renly and Stannis, lived in King's Landing until Jon Arryn's murder, which made Stannis to leave. 

And King's Landing is a city, not a castle."
19009552,TheEld,He has a very bad case of gout that makes it extremely painful for him to walk.
22117392,TheEld,It is spread through bodily fluids and can also survive in water. Generally people are afraid to even let those afflicted with greyscale touch them.
46682945,TheEld,"In the books Dany is only 15 when she meets Daario, who is in his early thirties. Daario is much more flamboyant and charismatic in the books. He looks like this, and that should tell you all you need to know: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/7/7a/Daario_naharis.jpg

Basically, she is a young girl infatuated with a confident and attractive man who also heaps compliments on her. It should also be said that Daario is a huge scumbag in the books. He really is a bloodthirsty cutthroat, much more so than his show counterpart. She knows that he is no good for her, but he is her escape to fantasy, pretty much.
"
32974931,TheEld,"The scene doesn't happen in the books, if you're wondering. Sansa never gets raped by Ramsay. She never even marries him."
27389484,TheEld,Only Balon Greyjoy. 
44687874,TheEld,Why do Muslims follow different hadiths? Why do Christians take different writings as canon?
17460211,TheEld,Yes.
33503461,TheEld,"About 5% of the material in Season 5 so far has been from the books. Season 1 was very close to the books (I'd give it an 85% similarity, maybe. The difference were usually just because of having a low budget). Season 2 took more liberties. Season 3 and 4 both really went off the rails and now in Season 5 the books are completely irrelevant to the show."
23816610,TheEld,"King Aegon IV publicly bestowed the Targaryen sword of kings, Blackfyre, on his bastard Daemon Waters instead of his legitimate son, Daeron Targaryen. Some felt that the sword symbolized the monarchy, as it had been the blade of Aegon the Conqueror, so the gift was the seed from which the Blackfyre Rebellions grew.

Aegon IV legitimised all of his bastards on his deathbed. His noble bastards were called the Great Bastards, the most notable of whom was Daemon, a great warrior and wielder of the Targaryen Blackfyre. He took the name Daemon Blackfyre from the sword.

In 184 AC, Aegon IV was succeeded by Daeron II Targaryen. King Daeron was a cultured, scholarly man and reigned over a sophisticated court, attended by maesters and learned men, which was perceived as effete and overly-refined, not pleasing to many of his more martial courtiers and nobles. His marriage to the Dornish princess Myriah introduced foreign influences and manners to the court, further adding to the displeasure with his reign. In addition to the aggravation of the Dornish influences at court, popular rumours held that King Aegon IV's sister-wife Naerys had shared her affections with their other brother, Prince Aemon Targaryen, leading to the possibility that Daeron II was not the son of Aegon IV.

After more than a decade of building tension, the Blackfyre Rebellion finally broke out in 195 AC engulfing all of Westeros, the seeds of this rebellion were planted early on, but it took years for them to bear fruit. There was no final insult, no great wrong that led Daemon Blackfyre to declare a war against Daeron. If it truly was love for Daenerys as some whisper why did Daemon wait eight years before rebelling. Especially since his wife Rohanne of Tyrosh had already given him seven sons and a daughter, while Daenerys had already had several children by Prince Maron.

In truth the war broke out because the seeds had found fertile ground because of Aegon the Unworthy. Aegon hated the Dornish and many Lords and Houses who spent centuries at war with the Dorne longed for the return of those days. Many great warriors looked on dismay on a realm no longer at war and did not like a peaceful, scholarly king who filled the court with learned men, Septons, Dornish and women. They looked at Daemon and saw a Warrior. Many lords and knights with grievances against the Iron Throne soon sought Daemon out.

Other factors was Daemons growing resentment at having the status of a bastard, and what it meant. Another was that he gained councillors who urged him to it. Daeron sent the Kingsguard to arrest him, but Daemon escaped with the aid of Ser Quentyn Ball, the master-at-arms of the Red Keep."
24361172,TheEld,Nope. Show Tyrion still thinks Tysha was really a whore. 
25889272,TheEld,He's just messing with you then.
22398795,TheEld,"When we first meet them in A Game of Thrones, Joffrey is 12 and Jon, Robb, and Gendry are all 14."
28312399,TheEld,What 12 year old girls from the books were made into adults in the show?
33034188,TheEld,"They used the same names as characters from the books, obviously. "
48567064,TheEld,Nope. They only know to fly one way. 
1105138,TheEld,Game of Thrones has nothing to do with A Song of Ice and Fire. Different stories. Start from the beginning. 
49064630,TheEld,Ned is largely responsible for the fact that he's at the Wall. Thorne was a Targaryen loyalist during the war and was defending King's Landing when it was sacked by Tywin. He was given the choice between death and the Wall.
33907553,TheEld,How much have you written?
43446653,TheEld,Lazy screenwriter #2.
34758907,TheEld,"It looked like you were saying he was from the Reach or something, lol."
22621831,TheEld,"How is that an error? A crowned stag has been the sigil of House Baratheon since Aegon's conquest, and before that it was the sigil of House Durrandon since the Dawn Age, according to legend."

33499110,TheEld,"That never happened in the books. Sansa never goes to Winterfell. She's at the Gates of the Moon right now and is pledged to be married to Harold Hardyng, the heir apparent to the Vale after Robert Arryn."
31007954,TheEld,The circumstances are very very different in the books.
24530023,TheEld,"No, he didn't. He got it from diving into the Rhoyne at Chroyane, and he certainly didn't start to show signs of the disease immediately after coming out of the water."
22945402,TheEld,Varys does not help Tyrion after he leaves King's Landing. 
30167096,TheEld,He isn't in the Kingsguard in the show.
22949984,TheEld,What? Of course not. What does feudalism have to do with slavery?
46738586,TheEld,I can go and take it off right now. Benjen Stark has been listed as reappearing on IMBD in at least Season 3 and Season 4.
18823421,TheEld,The Night's King is resurrecting Jon in the show.
46751289,TheEld,"Good point. Nobody carves anything into their bodies in the books. It just goes along with trying to make the Sparrows seem like terrorists in the show. That's a good question, though."
22678330,TheEld,"No. A crowned stag was the sigil of the Durrandons, the Storm Kings."
28363742,TheEld,"Most of the inhabitants of the Red Keep are not Lannisters... Cersei is there becaus she's the queen, Jaime is a Kingsguard knight, and Lancel and Tyrek are Robert's squires."
33517292,TheEld,No. Only Obara has a spear. And Tyene is the only one who has knowledge of poisons.
25750683,TheEld,The whole thing makes no sense whatsoever. Congratulations on recognizing it. 
19084621,TheEld,"Does he know that he didn't actually kill Bran and Rickon? Uh, yeah?"
28358008,TheEld,"Dany currently has about 10,600 Unsullied (about 2,000 of which are still very young and have not completed their training). She also only has about 20 Dothraki warriors. She wouldn't stand a chance without dragons."
38856286,TheEld,"About as intelligent as any other reptile, so not very, in other words. "
18961332,TheEld,It's pretty ridiculous in the show.

25013483,TheEld,More likely that is Sigorn and he and the other Thenns will show up and be the unexpected ally.
51550336,TheEld,"It would still have to be nullified by the High Septon or a Council of Faith, though."
25622844,TheEld,"Yeah, and the sorrowful man tries to kill Dany with one in the second one, in case you forgot. And Dany just saw manticores in cages when she was in the Eastern Market in Vaes Dothrak."
44682604,TheEld,"It is never going to happen in the show. And the post is tagged ""spoilers all""."
23095689,TheEld,That's not her.

43118857,TheEld,Nope. Never by that nmae.

26876263,TheEld,No. 
53938719,TheEld,"He talks to Illyrio about removing their tongues,"
51640855,TheEld,The sentence mentioning them in Asha's chapter is literally the only time they are mentioned. They are a clan.

22404069,TheEld,Are you sure you've read A Dance with Dragons?
47143880,TheEld,That's because it was just something made up on the spot by the writer.

34879795,TheEld,The very first one was this season with the random red priest in Volantis. The only time in the books that people from Yi Ti are encountered (would be played by Asian actors on-screen) is when Dany is in the Western Market of Vaes Dothrak.

24536736,TheEld,"How should anyone know whether any of the deities people pray to actually exist? The most likely answer is *probably not.* Also, I should add that the Faith is not polytheist. It only believes in one god. This god has seven aspects or seven faces, similarly to the Trinity in Christianity. The Great Other is also believed to be the god of cold, death, and darkness, not necessarily ice. "
47615253,TheEld,How about where you left off?
31196319,TheEld,The whole point of the marriage is to shore up the allegiances of the northern lords. House Bolton potentially has more legitimacy if a Stark is married to Ramsay.

20347705,TheEld,"Just plain awful. Same names but different people entirely. They didn't even try to get their ages, hair colors, or ethnicities right. And they should be having absolutely nothing to do with Ellaria. And they certainly should not want to kill Myrcella. The whole thing is bad fan-fiction at this point. And another thing... Apparently Ellaria is Tyene's mother in the show. Ellaria is not supposed to be the mother of Obara, Nymeria, or Tyene. "
33536813,TheEld,"Depends on who you ask. According to the Crown Tommen I Baratheon is the lord of Storm's End as well as the King. But according to Stannis he is the rightful lord of Storm's End, and he does still technically possess it at this point. His man, Gilbert Farring, is still holding the castle (though Stannis certainly has no control over all the lords of the region)."
17300098,TheEld,Of course.

46776125,TheEld,"None of them. The books have just stopped being very relevant because the characters in the show are no longer following the paths that their counterparts in the books do. If you want to know the main characters that have diverged the most, however, it would be Jaime, Brienne, Melisandre, Tyrion, Sam, Barristan, Davos, and Sansa. "

24564151,elbruce,"The people in Dorne plan to go to war to make Myrcella queen because in Dorne girls inherit over younger brothers.  Somebody tries to abduct her and she ends up with a big scar across her face. 

Another Dornish plan is to send Doran's son Quentyn to visit Dany because they were secretly betrothed when she was born.  He does.  Then he tries to set her dragons free and they roast his punk ass.

There was one guy ""Griff"" who is secretly Aegon Targaryen (Elia's son switched at birth with a random baby by Varys) travelling with a mercenary company who secretly serve a secret bastard line of Targaryens.  Tyrion was travelling with them instead of Jorah.  They play Westeros' version of chess a lot.  ""Griff"" is also supposed to try to marry Dany, I think.

The old king from the Iron Islands falls off his bridge and dies.  His brothers show up.  They have a big meeting to decide who the next king will be.  Much pirate badassery ensues.  Misogynist pirates don't like Asha(Yara) so she charges off on a mission to prove her badassery and immediately gets captured by Stannis.  One of the pirate uncles sets sail to go find Dany with a magic horn that's supposed to control dragons, maybe?  He probably wants to marry her too.

When Tyrion gets to Meereen it's being besieged by ridiculous slave armies from all of the other free cities.  He and Jorah get captured by the same guy and forced to become slave entertainers.  There's a massive outbreak of a horrible disease (not grayscale, but definitely lethal as hell) going on everywhere killing people off left and right.  Nothing happens except suckitude everywhere.

Danny marries Hizdar.  When they open the fighting pits, somebody tries to poison Dany but it didn't work because she wasn't hungry.  Nice plan, assassins.  Then DROGON OUTTA NOWHERE shows up and starts roasting people.  Dany jumps on his back and they fly away.  She hangs out at Drogon's cave for a while trying to figure out how to better control him.  Then she and her dragon meet a horde of Dothraki.

Arya is given a potion that makes her blind.  Then she gets a bunch more training.  Then they un-blind her, after she wargs into a cat to be able to fight without seeing.  She often dreams of being a direwolf leading a giant fucking pack of wolves around the Riverlands.  She then learns how to practice acting as other people, being observant, and coming up with clever plans to kill people.  Then they teach her the face trick.  It involves magic and actual faces cut off of dead people.

Sam, Gilly and Maester Aemon set sail to Oldtown but somehow get stuck in Braavos for way too long.  Gilly's baby was switched with Mance's baby; she has his, and hers was left behind.  She bawls at the top of her lungs for the entire book.  As soon as they manage to fina-fucking-ly pull away from Braavos, Maester Aemon goes ahead and kicks the bucket.

A bunch of guys from the Night's watch stab Jon to death with daggers over him importing the wildlings and wanting to go help fight in Stannis' war.

Stannis' army gets buried in a fuckton of snow and collectively freeze their asses off before even getting to Winterfell.

There's a bunch more, but those are all the plot threads I can recall at just this moment. "
8683771,elbruce,Thank you.  I was about to punch the Internet if this had turned out to be another Gendry post.

OP is clearly suggesting that there's a meaning other than what Aemon was intending..."

If you can't handle that, you should probably stop watching the show about now."
9476656,elbruce,"When Gendry was last seen in the show, Davos put him in a boat and said ""follow the coastline, that'll take you straight to King's Landing.""  Now of course everybody is insisting in this sub that he's anywhere *but* King's Landing, even though that's where the show we're talking about stated out loud that that's where he was going to.

I was just saying in another thread that if I was D&amp;D and I wanted to have the option of writing him back in, that's where I'd put him.  And I'd also be tempted to make him an extra in a crowd scene just to fuck with people.  So good catch, I hope you're right!"

10811686,elbruce,"And as he's pointed out, his current gambit is very high risk.  He's putting a lot on the line with the Sansa/Bolton hookup.  He's basically putting all his chips on her to survive and start playing the Game."

[Here's a really well thought out theory regarding Stannis' upcoming battles.](https://cantuse.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-night-lamp-revisited-the-wrath-of-the-old-and-the-new/)  I don't think he can die yet."
19877076,elbruce,"He's got a bit of a Young Anakin vibe, in terms of charisma and acting ability."

47100074,elbruce,"Don't know.  Arya's entire experience there might be custom-tailored to break her down without her even realizing what's happening.  It seems likely they're *1984*'ing her in some way.  I'm assuming that every interaction she has there is intentional.  For whatever psych-profile reason, whoever's in charge of her training program may have decided she needs to interact with someone also in training who seems to be ahead of her somewhat and mistreats her.

In fact, the OP image just made me realize another possibility I'd never considered: what if the blonde girl isn't a trainee at all, but a full-fledged FM posing as one?"

30469068,elbruce,"I'm still pretty sure the snake in a box thing was *made* by Cersei to manipulate Jaime into going after Myrcella.  If Myrcella still has her lion pendant, that'll confirm it."
7313796,elbruce,"The problem with giving a thorough and thoughtful discussion to this complaint (as I've already done) is that someone else will inevitably come along and post pretty much the same complaint again, and it'll get upvoted again.  So there's really no point."

And it's not like anybody in the Free Cities are putting up any real resistance to Danaerys now that she's signed with Meereen.  The Dothraki have been out of contention for how long now?  I rest my case.

Meanwhile in the Western Conference it's still anybody's game.  The Lannisters winning streak may be coming to an end, but you've still got the Tyrells, Stannis, and Roose, all competing at the top of their game, bringing an incredibly strong season and posting up numbers like crazy.  Plus the Martells are starting to make their move after a long rebuilding phase, and Littlefinger's a complete wildcard now that he's signed with the Vale.  Anything could happen."

8489741,elbruce,"I completely agree.  A while back I figured out how to calculate plot armor.  If a character isn't necessary to move the story forward, they can die.  If their death would create a dead-end that makes having told this story thread pointless, they won't die.  So for example, Bran has plot armor because if he died you'd have to ask why so many chapters were wasted on his journey North; it would be *bad writing* to have done so.

I don't think Bronn is needed in the books or the show.  He was given his ""happily ever after"" scenario and then dragged back away from it into the fray."

Whispers:  **Tyrion Lannister.**  He understands double-dealing and intrigue, but doesn't have his own agenda, unlike most of the other people who are good at that stuff.  He just wants to be given a job worthy of his talents.

Not that they *will* write him back into the show, but if he's chilling in King's Landing, they could easily bring him back into the action any time they want.  With D&amp;D going completely off the rails relative to the books, they might actually choose to exercise that option.  Their main goal right now seems to be recycling old characters over introducing new ones, to keep fan favorite actors on screen as much as possible."

It's just that A) Cersei *has* been horrible to Margaery in the past, B) Cersei is an awful person in general, and C) Cersei is making it clear that she's not going to give up running the kingdom even though Tommen is legally an adult.  Which means she gots to *go.*"

24415224,elbruce,"Before they would cut things or play with the timing of events.  Now they're writing their own material.  We've been warned for at least a year now that that was going to happen.  If you're not OK with that, then you should stop watching because there's only going to be more of it."
44606281,elbruce,Two days without hair product and *foomf!*  It ain't easy being Margaery.
44567712,elbruce,That's what I thought before too.  But it's the only explanation for how he could have caught the old lady.  So obviously the evidence shows that your theory is false.
44532709,elbruce,"People constantly see-saw between complaining that years should have passed in about the last 8 episodes, and complaining about how Littlefinger manages to travel places between whole episodes."
8441207,elbruce,"A recent AVClub review was pointing out that in earlier seasons, while everyone was still learning about Westeros and its people, characters could more afford to throw in a seemingly irrelevant expositional story because it was part of introducing the interesting world.  Now that everyone feels like they have a sense of what the world is like, an exposition/background speech seems more forced because we expect everything to be plot-driven from here on out.  I'm not sure whether I entirely agree with that, but it does make some sense.  There's less time for stopping the action to tell you a cool story just because it's cool; everything has to mean something."
1208877,elbruce,"It's one thing for it to be a rumor, it's another for it to be confirmed by a firsthand eyewitness from a noble family known for its honor.

Robert would definitely have lost his shit based on Bran's testimony."
8447827,elbruce,"All I remember is Davos told him to follow the coast and he'd be in King's Landing, which is where he wanted to go.  Could he have gotten lost and ended up somewhere else?  Sure.  But that would be a ""something *else* happened"" scenario, which would require a scene to validate.  The path of most obviousness is that he went to where he was going.

The only people who knew his face and who were in KL are dead now.  Heck, he could probably go back to the guy he was originally working for, since Ned just paid him to take him away without saying why, and Ned's been dead a long time now.  ""Looks like I got laid off the other job due to boss got executed, this one still open?""

Honestly if people want Gendry back in the show so bad, him keeping his head down and working as a blacksmith in KL would be a great place to have stashed him, since he'd be near the action and they could write him back in easily.  Heck, if I were D&amp;D and I really wanted to tease fans, I'd throw him in as an extra in a crowd scene."
7331729,elbruce,"He's hanging out in the safe house with Huell.

But seriously, Davos told him how to get to King's Landing, so we can assume that's where he is.  We don't actually have to see his boat land to see it land.  Believe it or not, things happen in the world that they don't spend time filming and showing to you."
13648632,elbruce,"It's OK, nothing upsetting happens after that point.  You should catch up."
19850837,elbruce,Just enjoy the acting.  Michelle Fairley gives the performance of a lifetime.  Everybody else is exquisite too.  It's like watching a really amazing version of a Shakespeare tragedy.
26114106,elbruce,"In the show he has a conversation with Sam where they're looking at a map and trying to figure out where Bran could have gotten to, and decide Craster's is the only place.  Then almost immediately the issue with the Craster's mission comes up.  But Jon definitely had two purposes in going there."
47059172,elbruce,"As I said before, I had thought it was for Brienne, that's what seemed to be the most plausible.  It's not an idea I didn't have.  Until the old woman showed up flayed with no explanation for how Ramsay knew it was her.

In the scenes prior to Sansa's wedding she didn't seemed to be locked in at all.  People were coming and going from her room without any keys involved.  And she was walking about Winterfell at will."
2466916,elbruce,"Melisandre is convinced that Stannis is or will become the new Azor Ahai.

Thoros doesn't give a fuck about any of that shit, but still somehow managed to summon the power of fiery resurrection into Beric Dondarrion.

And this new priestess is an example of many R'hllor faithful in Essos who are convinced that Danaerys will be their savior.

There is no ""official"" ruling on this that all R'hllor clergy follow.  They go out among the world, they look at visions in the flames, and they interpret those visions the best they can.  Naturally, they come to different conclusions based on those interpretations.  It's not a centralized religion, more like an evangelical one with no official center."
30473468,elbruce,"Yeah really, if they're going to cut extraneous scenes, that one should go."
44582950,elbruce,"He's about a year old.  He was born about 10 episodes ago.  So that's over a month between each episode, which is perfectly reasonable.  And would give Littlefinger enough travel time while it's at it."
2422898,elbruce,"They made a radio out of fucking coconuts.  &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

52645160,elbruce,"It's hard to truly dislike Jorah because all of his worst flaws, as bad as they are, are a lot like things I've done in the past too.  He's just *really* bad about women.  He gets overly hung up on women he shouldn't try to be with, and then he makes incredibly stupid choices to try to get or keep them.  We've all done those sorts of things in our own past relationships, although most of us get over that level of stupid well before we get to his age.

Other than that (which is impossibly to truly dislike him for) he's an all-around great character."
33044126,elbruce,The best we can hope for sometimes is for the bad guys to take their share of ass-beatings too.  Case in point: Joffrey.  That's all we're after here.
7539449,elbruce,Somehow I don't think Sansa minds so much.
1228881,elbruce,"He might or might not die, but he'll definitely get busted for it.  The Sparrows have yet to execute anybody though.  Maybe public shaming, limited punishment and penance is enough for them.  We'll see."
12243672,elbruce,"They beat *Robert* himself.  Broke and scattered his forces, left him seriously wounded, and chased him into the Westerlands, where he became Tywin's problem.  Then the Tyrells turned back and had a nice picnic outside of Storm's End until the war was over.  If Tywin had actually bothered to do his job and caught Robert then, the rebellion would have been quickly and easily suppressed."
22866807,elbruce,"They've only got so many characters per scene, so many scenes per episode, and so many episodes per season, to tell this huge epic story.  They've been trimming that down by re-using characters who are already pretty thoroughly developed in place of introducing new ones.  I think it's a natural consequence of being mired in your existing set of expectations (gotta kill people!  gotta have spectacle and sex and suspense!) but I think even more people would complain even more loudly if they *didn't* keep up expectations.  But I honestly can't picture in any detail how to do this job better than they are.  I like to imagine that adapting the most unadaptable work in the history of fiction is something I'd be better at than them, but then again I can't dunk on LeBron James either."

29299852,elbruce,*True Detective* season 1 went on about it all the time.  Both ASOIAF and that show are referencing an obscure old novel.
6626520,elbruce,"That would have been a great line.  But it might give away more of his plot to us than they want right now, though."
10870047,elbruce,"Somewhere around here there's a close-up screenshot of Littlefinger's reply to Cersei with some of the words legible on it, that suggests he gave her permission to raid his brothel and collect witnesses for trial."
8863646,elbruce,"Jonathan Price is good at portraying A) sweet nice guys, and B) brilliant master villains.  I think he's going to transform from the one into the other at some point in the future, and it'll be awesome."
24706709,elbruce,Aaand it got invaded by /r/fatpeoplehate.  Great.
8685861,elbruce,You didn't even put a Tyrion &amp; Dany scene on your list.  For shame.
8642337,elbruce,There are always supposed to be 7 of them.  Just because the show hasn't shown each individual appointment doesn't mean they aren't being replaced as necessary.
8634230,elbruce,"The more major a character is to future books, the more D&amp;D will have to juggle if they remove that character from play now.  They do have an outline of where GRRM is going in the future.  I think Jaime is likely to remain a key player going forward.  Bronn, not so much."
44542412,elbruce,"Honestly, I think a lot of the stuff people keep saying was cut just hasn't been done *yet.*  I don't think they wanted to do both books worth of simultaneous plotlines at once, so they're pushing others back.  If they'd done everything simultaneously that was going on in both books simultaneously, we'd only see any members of the established cast like once every four episodes at most."
24768811,elbruce,*Stannis is seated at an inn's table with Selyse and Shireen.  Melisandre is running late.  She enters  from outside.  Stannis momentarily eyes a large blonde woman in armor sitting on a stool.  They they look at their menus.  Don't stop believin'... fade to black.*
32123096,elbruce,"And Cersei replied ""they hurt little girls everywhere.""  Oberyn has a bit of a rose-colored view."
13787168,elbruce,"She has a lot of potential.  And those things signal that her potential should soon start turning into results.  If it doesn't, then I'm going to be really annoyed by the writers."
24734578,elbruce,"I'm sure we'll see her again; while not fully A-list, that actress is too well known to only be cast for a single scene.

However, I'm glad that GRRM is a better writer than all the people who think ""Red Priest/ess"" is the cure for any and every plot problem because let's assume all of them can do anything."
10910998,elbruce,Why would she think that?  Sansa vanished from KL during Jpffrey's wedding while LF was half a continent away (as far as anyone knew).
44621579,elbruce,"I feel about the ""Lancel killed Robert"" claim the same way I feel about the ""Littlefinger bankrupted the kingdom"" theory: everybody keeps making excuses for Robert, and acting like his subordinates had the power to tell him what to do or override his orders.

So what if his wine was fortified?  If he was drinking so much he couldn't taste the difference, it didn't matter anyways.  It's not like Lancel can tell him ""no, you've had enough"" without getting his head bitchslapped clean off.  If Robert wants to get drunk and fight boars, Robert's going to get drunk and fight boars.  It was a risky activity, and it ended up killing him.  Which was always a possibility either way.

And remember the scene where Robert wanted to go jousting and Ned had to talk him out of it?  That was technically another Cersei ""assassination attempt.""  She was the one who goaded him into it.  There was a chance that could have killed him too.

But letting Robert try to get his own stupid ass killed isn't murder.  An ""assassination attempt"" that amounts to adding a limited percentage to your chance of dying anyways hardly qualifies.  One might as well claim Cersei also tried to kill him by feeding him a high cholesterol diet."
44592471,elbruce,"Yeah, I had that happen to me once."
8559829,elbruce,"Another point about the Unsullied is that as Daario pointed out, they're not suited towards cramped street fighting.  They're not badass 1-on-1 fighters at all - the fact that Grey Worm is is a show-induced aberration.  What makes them badass is that they don't break formation, no matter what comes down on them.  Well after anybody else would piss themselves and go ""every man for himself!"" and run off in random directions, the Unsullied reform their line and keep fighting, down to the last man.  That makes them incredibly formidable against other armies, but it doesn't mean that any one of them is any good as a duellist.  Put them in a narrow street where they don't have room to form an extended phalanx and they're not much better than your average mook.

&gt; My only real gripe with the scene is why would they bother having that tease where the last harpy slitting Barristans throat is thwarted by Grey worm, if they were just gonna say he's dead anyway?

I think they wanted to make it a cliffhanger, but fucked that up with the preview and releasing the fact that the character was dead out of show (actor interview being published, etc).  If things had gone according to (better) plan, we'd all still be hoping Barry was still alive and then get our kick in the nuts next episode."
19848946,elbruce,"Don't worry Jorah, she'll still keep an extra guy on the side... Daario."
7545493,elbruce,"This happens with a lot of TV shows.  It's the reason that *Glee* kept the same original characters well after most of them graduated instead of rotating new people in and old people out.  You get hung up on the characters you started with.

The problem is, GoT has a *lot* of new characters it needs to introduce coming up, and as we've seen, a lot of old favorites have died.  Either you can get on board with the new ones or you can't.

The showrunners seem to be aware of this and have been trying to re-use the ""original"" characters as much as possible, changing their arcs so instead of being sidelined, they take over more of the plotlines that would otherwise go to new characters.  I suspect this is driving most of the drastic changes they're making from the books this season.  So they clearly are trying to keep familiar faces on your screen as often as possible.  Still, there are limits to how much of that they can plausibly manage."
2487031,elbruce,"If they're going to have LSH, there's only one way to do it: Beric Dondarrion gets sick of still living and breathes the fiery resurrection energy of R'hllor into a corpse to pass it on.  There's not much point in having her at all without the explanation of why she can exist.  And if they're going to go to enough trouble to explain that, they might as well keep it with Cat.

Typically the ""combining aspects of characters"" is being done to cut down on the number of minor and secondary characters needed.  Combining major characters into one is irrelevant to that purpose."
21110709,elbruce,"Honestly the fact is the show is going to deviate from the books.  Either learn to like it or you might as well stop watching, because the show is going to deviate from the books *more* the longer it goes on.  And there's no change they could make that you'd like."
19876380,elbruce,"Oh, there were *plenty* of screen-caps of that shot.  Photoshopped various ways, put up against various other scenes, etc.  This sub was pretty much nothing but those two scenes juxtaposed for a week."
13757783,elbruce,"I'm thinking Littlefinger could just tell Cersei that the ""Sansa"" being married to Ramsay is an impostor and is secretly his niece Alayne.  Cersei would probably think that was a pretty good plan of his, lie to all the Northmen to get them to fall in line.  

Besides, Tyrion already took the fall for Joffrey.  That case is considered closed.  As Roose pointed out, the armies of the South have never ever bothered to go that far North for any reason.  If they won't march up there to stop Stannis, then they sure as hell won't march up there just to get Sansa.

As for Arya, who's going to spot her?  By the time anybody who even *might* remember what she looked like shows up, she'll probably be pretty good at looking like other people."
6732964,elbruce,Seems like their M.O.  They take characters we've already gotten used to and loaded them up with elements and roles that were taken by new characters in the books.  Helps give the favorites more screen time.
19800028,elbruce,"I'd rather have it fully come out in the story (either books or TV show) than some ""confirming"" hint."
13751430,elbruce,Their first recital.  They really want to make Dany proud.  They've been practicing all season!
44468302,elbruce,"""Now tell me I'll never become king!"""
10828206,elbruce,"I used to disapprove of everybody (Robert, Cersei, Tyrion) treating Lancel like shit all the time.  After last night's episode, I think I'm up for a rewatch just to watch them all kick him around again."
10864842,elbruce,"In the books, Tommen is like 7-9 years old.

He signs royal decrees because he likes using the big wax stampy thingy and he wants to outlaw beets."
52609116,elbruce,That one is way better.
24710198,elbruce,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7O0MFkmpw
8689684,elbruce,"Honestly, when Tommen looked back at the people gathered behind him yelling, it looked like a moment of calculation to me.  He was like ""this could escalate into some Joffrey-scale bullshit, best tap the brakes.""

Yeah, he wants to solve the Loras problem but it's going to take a bit more than just marching straight to the place where he is and demanding him back immediately.  Or else there's going to be widespread blood in the streets.  It's not too much to ask Loras to chill for a bit to avoid mass rioting."
19846423,elbruce,That's a very Jorah-like decision though.  He's really awful at impressing women.
7314565,elbruce,That would be pretty awesome.
24680761,elbruce,Or she's wearing Winterfell style clothing as appropriate to being in Winterfell.  That would be my first guess.
6593265,elbruce,"&gt; there's no reason why one Dornishman wouldn't hate Robert for starting the whole damn war.

There's no reason why one *would* want to go after Shireen.  Handling a horribly infectious disease with no known cure is an incredibly dangerous and sloppy way to go about killing an innocent person who's multiple steps removed from someone you *might* have a tangential motive to dislike.  You could use this level of tinfoilery to blame anyone for anything that's happened to anyone."

2. The only place Bran could have gotten to before freezing was if he stopped off at Craster's.
3. Jon looked at Crasters and didn't find Bran.  Then he burned it down.

As far as Jon could know, Bran is dead.

I would like to take this moment to remind everybody that the characters in the books haven't read the books."
2476972,elbruce,"His roles are as follows:

6624549,elbruce,He took down their whole fucking crew.  I'd say he did pretty damn well for himself.
9553593,elbruce,"I don't think the show is really getting into keeping track of who all of the Kingsguard are at any given moment.  There are 7 of them (including Jaime and Trant), they're top-level knights appointed as necessary, and that's all the show needs to keep track of."
52650355,elbruce,"It's funny, every time the show drops a bunch of reminders of something leading up to it being relevant, everyone complains that they've dumbed it down too much.  But every time they *don't,* people say that'll never happen because they haven't been dropping enough reminders lately."
7338845,elbruce,"What I'm interested in is how much more of her we're going to see.  That actress was Rila Fukushima, who plays Katana on *Arrow.*  She's not a huge star, but she's way too big of a name to only have in a single scene."
6565378,elbruce,I've had some sex that made me feel like that for at least week.  Just sayin'.
44552453,elbruce,"She says right at the very beginning of the scene that Doran wanted to ease his concerns over her safety and treatment.

Remember, Doran, the guy who runs things there, is the one who *doesn't* want to start a war with the Lannisters.  Jaime is going to be just fine.  And it's not like he thinks Jaime wants to hurt Myrcella."
10888993,elbruce,I think they're trying to avoid flooding the screen with too many faces at once.  They're basically taking turns with all the new characters that need to come in.  Dorne is up first.

It was one thing when it was a ""wouldn't it be funny if"" speculation, ha ha.  Then it was funny for people to kinda act like they believed that was the outcome, ha ha.  But people keep pushing it like they actually think they really do believe in it.  You don't."

24419536,elbruce,"Actually subbing Sansa in for Jeyne tightens the scripting up a lot, assuming they can resolve this plotline without any permanent damage to major events.  They're basically using the characters who've been with us for a long time in place of introducing lots of brand new faces that people will have a harder time keeping track of and who the audience won't care about immediately.  Because they don't have time to add scenes of Sansa's (really boring) Vale subplot, and the alternative would be to cut Sophie Turner out of the show for the foreseeable future, while simultaneously introducing a Jeyne Poole out of nowhere for the audience to start to get used to.  Seems like a smart decision, and I think it's working out well."

Unofficially, until the day Tommen says ""mother, I disagree"" to her (about anything whatsoever) she can ride by on her rickety fake authority.  But it's going to make the Crown look incredibly weak for as long as it last.  The sooner she accepts retirement, the stronger the kingship will be."

If the show is doing it, then it's sure to be true in the books as well.  GRRM has the scope and time to craft a complicated red herring; D&amp;D don't.  If it weren't going to be true, they wouldn't waste time giving us more clues that point towards it.  And certainly not so many clues all at once.

&gt;  Why is Sansa standing at her aunt Lyanna's crypt, anyway, rather than her father's, or her uncle Brandon's, or her grandfather Rickard's?

I could theorize that since she's (yet again) in a situation where she's being held by bad guys, she's trying to draw strength from Lyanna who (as far as she knows) was also being held by bad guys."

Look at the gif above.  The problem with the dagger girl was that she was way too close.  If she were advancing from further back it could have looked more threatening and Bronn could have extended his sword cut instead of pulling in.  But then she would have been out of frame.  That's not her fault, that's on the director.

If you watch the Oberyn/Mountain fight again, you may notice that each film cut lasted on average less than a second.  That scene is Franken-edited together like crazy (to spot actual good fight-scene skills, look for long takes).  It's sad to think that the Sand Snake scene was made from the best footage they had.  The rest must have been laughable.

The problem was that no matter how much money you have, you don't get to use that location for more than they got.  They had 1 week to film all of the Water Garden scenes for the entire season.  Good fight choreography takes more time than that.  Also, the direction for fight scenes seems to really suck this year.  But blaming the actors for that is just silly, and demonstrates a severe lack of understanding of film production."

24662265,elbruce,"Remember when Cersei said there were only two of that lion pendant, one on her and one on Myrcella?  An eagle-eyed user in this sub caught a still of Sansa in S1 or 2 wearing it.  It's the one Joffrey gave her.  Also, it showed up well before Ellaria could have sent it, since he had *just* tried asking Doran to do something and been rebuffed.  Which means Cersei faked the threat in order to send Jaime down there.  All he has to do is see that Myrcella is still wearing the lion pendant to realize that Cersei duped him.  That'll sour him on her.

I'm still holding out hope for LSH.  But to be honest there's still plenty of time to introduce her, even into next season depending on how much they cram in from the books.  I mean, they still haven't touched the Iron Islands; they could go well into season 6 on what they've got already."

27415749,elbruce,"&gt; But why would Littlefinger do this? That's what's stumping me.

Solution: Joffrey did it.

Littlefinger and/or Varys gave him the identities and locations of the bastards, without knowing (but perhaps suspecting) what he intended to do about it.  Littlefinger to curry favor, and Varys because it turns out he's a Targ loyalist and wouldn't be against culling the Baratheon line as much as possible.  Also, it's his job."

Example: people take shits.  Conclusion: everyone on the show (not just Tywin) has been taking a shit on a regular basis.  They don't have to show you that on the screen.  They might show you if someone had severe constipation; *then* you can assume that the obvious thing *isn't* happening."

2. Roose has yet to announce publicly that Sansa is up there.  He will soon if he wants to get those wedding invitations out to the northern lords, but afaik he hasn't yet.
3. If push comes to shove, Littlefinger can just tell Cersei that it's an impostor Sansa.  His niece Alayne is pretending to be Sansa in order to help the Boltons bring the north in line.  Littlefinger gets his blood married into the Bolton line in exchange for helping them secure their realm.  She'd fall for it.

The Red Wedding was a violation of loyalty (via Roose) and guest right (via Walder).  Those are the morals of the world they live in, so it stands to reason that their world should judge them for it.  But a lord killing a few peasants to serve a political purpose is the norm there.

The problem with Theon was, he backed himself into a corner.  He set it up so that he'd look completely ineffectual if he didn't track down Bran and Rickon.  If he'd gone back to Winterfell with the people knowing the Stark heirs had hoodwinked him, there would have been constant undermining and insurrection.  That said, he managed the whole thing horribly from the start.  Backing himself into corners was his entire arc back then.

He should have listened to his sister regarding how to Greyjoy.  Sack Winterfell, sure, but then GTFO back on a boat.  Take Bran &amp; Rickon with you, for fuck's sake.  Now that would have been a power play."

2. We see Arya assume one identity in ADWD, and one more in a sample chapter for TWOW.

3. Some people think Syrio is a FM.  Others aren't so sure.  The books might never confirm it either way.

Theon is a ward, which is more than just a hostage.  Remember, Ned and Robert were wards to Jon Arryn.  Littlefinger was a ward to House Tully.  None of those were for ""hostage"" purposes.  While the ""hostage"" advantage does apply in Theon's case, the main point is to form lifelong friendships for the next generation, an ""old boy's network"" as it were.  

Robb and Theon were very close; if everything had gone according to plan, there would have been a lasting friendship forged between the future Lords of Winterfell and Pyke that would last at least for the next generation, if not longer.  It was a very long-term strategy to forge a lasting peace with the Iron Islands."
8313304,elbruce,"Van Oster would call in to the DEA office when they didn't come back, if only to find out who the hell was taking the next shift.

They would then bring him into the office to question him about that and he'd describe his last conversation with Hank.  Then they'd let him go because they actually have no reason to keep him and know of nobody to protect him from.

This is so fucking obvious, it's just a matter of applying ""what would happen if this were actually a real world with its own continuity.""  People take shits that aren't filmed.  When they get in a car in one scene and arrive somewhere else in that car in another, we can assume they drove the intermediate distance in that car.  If someone gets in a boat and is rowing to place X, you can assume after a certain amount of time they got to place X even if you didn't see their fucking boat land.  We don't need our hand held and to see literally every tiny detail on the screen in front of our eyeballs or else we have to assume they *didn't* happen.  That's utterly fucking imbecilic.

Rather, we should assume the *most likely* outcome is going to happen by itself *unless* we see an unusual plot point to change that.  Davos sent Gendry rowing to King's Landing.

Their marriage is surprisingly good, all things considered.  Roose says she's fun in the sack (being a bit of a squealer), and she seems to enjoy her role as the lady of an important House.  Roose does mention that if she starts having children Ramsay will probably kill them and she'll probably grieve over them.  And he says it in a sort of ""sucks to be her"" kind of way.

I don't think LF has custody of Gendry.  I think Gendry went right back to the King's Landing blacksmith, and LF has been keeping tabs on that fact via spies."
10399655,elbruce,"A crown without Cersei is *much* stronger.  Him letting his mommy rule for him after he's married makes him look weak.  He's got Margaery to be his brain.  All he needs is to put together a decent Small Council and he'll be fine.

As I've said elsewhere, Tommen is perfect for a Tyrell style marriage.  He can be nice and sweet and look pretty on the throne while the Tyrell ladies take care of the real dirt behind his back.  He's like a young Mace.  And things have worked out perfectly for Mace all his life.

Also, as other posters have noted, having the new location of the repository for the stone men be specifically the ruins of old Valyria makes total sense on some level. Though it's far from the original book location of the ruins of Chroyane on the mighty Rhoyne, that is obviously out since Tyrion's riverboat adventure got downgraded to a wheelhouse ride with severely limited face-gazing options, and it just...feels right, somehow. Just picture it: The smoking post-Doom ruins, crawling with terrifying stone men! I think if GRRM had written it that way, no one reading the book would have complained."")"

&gt;He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and she looked into his eyes. “No?” he said, and she knew it was a question. She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. “Yes,” she whispered as she put his finger inside her.

Dany is afraid, but decidedly in control, or at least significantly more so than she appeared in that scene on the show. However, yes, it does sound like straight up rape later on. My guess is that the showrunners wanted to capture that later feeling in the first time, but that's not how that moment went down in the books. I was just trying to ward off potential criticism of comparisons between Sansa's and Dany's respective rape scenes due to Dany's wedding night situation being significantly different in the books, because really here all that matters is how the two scenes were portrayed on the the show, and that would be quite similarly."

47042181,havron,"From Victarion's second chapter (""The Reaver"") in AFFC:

&gt;The Crow’s Eye filled two cups with a strange black wine that flowed as thick as honey. “Drink with me, brother. Have a taste of this.” He offered one of the cups to Victarion.
&gt;The captain took the cup Euron had not offered, sniffed at its contents suspiciously. Seen up close, it looked more blue than black. It was thick and oily, with a smell like rotted flesh. He tried a small swallow, and spit it out at once. “Foul stuff. Do you mean to poison me?”
&gt;“I mean to open your eyes.” Euron drank deep from his own cup, and smiled. “Shade-of-the-evening, the wine of the warlocks. I came upon a cask of it when I captured a certain galleas out of Qarth, along with some cloves and nutmeg, forty bolts of green silk, and four warlocks who told a curious tale. One presumed to threaten me, so I killed him and fed him to the other three. They refused to eat of their friend’s flesh at first, but when they grew hungry enough they had a change of heart. Men are meat.”

Then, in Daenerys's third chapter in ADWD (which would be chronologically a bit earlier than Vic's above), a very much alive and not-locked-in-a-vault book-version Xaro Xhoan Daxos warns her:

&gt;“Not all your enemies are in the Yellow City. Beware men with cold hearts and blue lips. You had not been gone from Qarth a fortnight when Pyat Pree set out with three of his fellow warlocks, to seek for you in Pentos.”"

I've read the books once (some twice; my reread is still in progress) and seen every episode three or four times, and I am still noticing new things. It's incredible.

Six Feet Under is about a family that runs a funeral home in Los Angeles, which is where series creator Alan Ball calls ""the world capital of the denial of death"". Every character is realistically complex, each with strong personality traits often in direct opposition to each other. There's the sort of emo teen who's actually creative and unique (not so trendy as you'd think), the selfish older brother who conceals a soft spot for folks in need, the gay younger brother (played by a younger Michael C. Hall, aka TV's Dexter) hiding a wild streak behind a prim and proper exterior, and the mother who's trying to keep it all together and her family life normal and uneventful despite how tragically impossible that is given the crazy circumstances they all live under. I'd tell you more, including something crucial that defines a lot of what happens in the show, but is first episode spoilers that honestly is much better as a surprise. You've got it free to stream on Amazon Prime, so I highly recommend you go and watch the first episode and then let me know what you think. It really hits the ground running and is excellent throughout, getting still better and better each season, building up to what is universally acclaimed as quite possibly the best series finale ever aired on television. Great stuff, I promise you. If you like dramas and human stories, you will adore it.

Yeah, not everything is on Amazon Prime, but so much is on there that if you have broad tastes, it is well worth it (plus, free shipping on nearly everything?? Heck yeah!). I'm a sci-fi buff, and having access to all the Star Treks, the X-Files, the new Battlestar Galactica (an absolute MUST SEE), and much, much more makes it worth it alone, as far as I'm concerned.

I wouldn't say Adventure Time is anything like South Park; there is satire, but it's far more subtle. It really is a truly unique show. The closest thing on TV today I'd compare it to is probably Steven Universe (also a great cartoon) but even that doesn't come close. It truly does stand in a class by itself."
33417481,havron,"Fair point, but I'm not so sure. If you read that chapter in its entirety, it's made pretty clear that, yes, Dany has no choice, but during that passage Drogo ends up being more gentle than she expected and, gradually, she seems to come to decide that, yes, she wants this. Not so much when he repeatedly takes her forcefully later on, of course, but in the end she comes to use her own powers to get what she wants from him. I am hoping that Sansa is able to do so as well but in a different way, manipulating Ramsay until she makes her move and exacts her revenge."

I feel quite confident that this is what is going to happen, as I simply cannot believe that we are simply seeing the showrunners continually hurting Sansa because it's fun for them.

I was just commenting on the irritating lack of lighting in so many scenes this season. It's really hard to see sometimes, even with the brightness on the screen turned all the way up. I really don't understand why the creators have chosen to do this. I am hoping they ""remaster"" it for the Blu-ray and DVD releases. It just looks terrible."
30845647,havron,"Yep, exactly. I was just trying to be tactful in case anyone would prefer to be surprised. :)"
41487826,havron,"The first part of it is in S04E04, ""Oathkeeper"", in the scene between Sansa and Littlefinger on his ship:

""A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.""
"
36292028,havron,"Yes. So, this would be a good reason for the show to bring him back late this season, and thus (hopefully) give us the epilogue from ADWD. He may have no patience for Cersei's foolishness, but one she is out of the way he would return for duty's sake. I suspect that if they had wanted to just write Kevan out of the show, they wouldn't have even bothered showing him at all this season. I doubt very much that many show watchers would have wondered where he had gone."

Buy them while they're firm and then, once a day, press your finger into the surface to see if the impression stays. Once it does, eat it that very day. If you are impatient, it's undersweet; wait too long, and it gets mushy and gross quickly. Totally worth the exorbitant price they tend to be sold at if you eat them at the right time!"
41495769,havron,"Too soon, man."
33302517,havron,"This. Yes, the rape scene in the first episode is significantly less rapey in the books, but most people don't read the books and the show portrayed it in a manner not unlike what we all witnessed Sunday night. That leaves the main difference that we have had four and a half seasons to become invested in Sansa's character, while Daenerys was new to us back then. So, what, are we only supposed to get upset when someone we know gets raped? Come on, people. This is a brutal world and brutal things happen to people who don't deserve them. Kudos to the show's creators and actors for portraying this horrible act with the weight it deserves. It *should* bother us! The fact that it is causing such a stir in the media is testament to the acting proficiency of the cast. Let's applaud them for getting it right, and then keep tuning in to find out what happens next. I for one expect Sansa to kick some Bolton ass soon!"

18642439,havron,"Furthermore, S05E04 (""Sons of the Harpy"") is the first time an episode had fewer viewers than the corresponding episode the previous season. As has been said, I blame the leaks."
50897592,havron,"As hopeful as I am as anyone, never trust IMDB cast listings as pretty much anyone can edit them. The title of Episode 10 certainly refers to [S5E10](#s ""Cersei receiving the Mother's mercy from the Faith for her Walk of Pennance""), although there are typically multiple meanings for episode titles so I hope you're right.

If *someone* can make that journey, at all, then one could find enough other people who can and have them slowly transport enough stone to build the bloody thing. I'm not saying it's necessarily in any way particularly feasible, but it's certainly not *impossible*. Sure, it might take centuries and that might be too long for anyone to reasonably wait to get it built, but my point is that it physically could be done. I don't care how difficult it is or how long it would take or how absurd the effort would need to be. ""Impossible"" is a very black-and-white term, which does not apply here."

36210652,havron,"Then what are you doing in a book spoilers thread?? =P

Well, if you don't mind being spoiled, it's from Jaime's penultimate chapter in the fourth book, *A Feast for Crows*. In that book, he is given the task of restoring order to the Riverlands and essentially cleaning up after the war (as /u/ProfessorBinns so eloquently puts it, his ""Bitchslapping the Riverlands Tour""). At this point in the story, the Blackfish holds Riverrun and Jaime has an army composed of former Tully bannermen including Freys (loyal to the Lannisters since the Red Wedding) and a very captive Edmure, who as the Tully liege lord Jaime is trying to get to command the Blackfish to surrender the castle. It's a pretty awesome scene, and this speech that finally gets Edmure to acquiesce is one of my favorites in all the books. Such a badass moment for Jaime, and a real shame to be cut from the show. It would have been so glorious to see on television."
8177544,havron,"Thanks to note curling and selective focus, all I can make out are the short phrases ""of further"" and ""[my?] establishment""."
11442827,havron,"When you go back and rewatch, his ascent to her council becomes much clearer. There are even multiple close-up reaction shots of him during the scene of Daenerys' arrival at the gates of Meereen in S04E03. None of us noticed then, of course, because we had no idea who he was; not even us book readers, who had no way of knowing that *that dude* was Hizdahr.

So many characters. It's a lot to track. Rewatching helps a TON."
18843726,havron,"That is indeed the title of Episode 9, confirmed last week."
11536714,havron,"Huh, really? That's a truly bizarre cheat code... Well, I use SwiftKey on my phone, so that would be exceedingly difficult to do as hitting an extra space inserts the next predicted word.

Why not just honor the formatting we enter? I mean, I get removing extra lines to prevent trolls from taking up absurd amounts of vertical space for nothing or whatever, but what's wrong with letting a single newline be a newline? I don't get it."

28574801,havron,"Yeah you're right, there were some slow moments in some episodes of Game of Thrones, including ""The Climb"", but that speech definitely more than made up for them. And the lulls pretty much always made sense in context. Regarding Breaking Bad, the episode ""Fly"" comes to mind as one that at first made me wonder what the point of all that was, but then I realized it really showed just how obsessed Walt had become about what he was doing and how much he had lost sight of *why* he was doing it.

Cool! Six Feet Under is great. Let me know what you think after the first episode, and keep in mind it gets even better. There are some real gritty moments in the show, and some very real explorations of the nature of grief and loss that truly hit home for anyone who has ever lost someone they love. And plenty of great human drama first and foremost.

Yeah, I tend to get into recommended shows and binge watch them, analyze, rewatch, then finally move on to the next thing. I love getting completely absorbed into an engrossing fictional world. It's a diversion like no other. Six Feet Under, Breaking Bad, and Game of Thrones are among the best in that regard. The Walking Dead is a different beast entirely: an interesting concept with some compelling characters (but they could be better), but not always so well executed. I keep up with it, but it's definitely in a different tier than the truly great dramas. I'd put Vikings in that category as well, though there are times it is very Game of Thrones-esque and totally badass. I'd recommend checking out that one as well, but yeah, no Game of Thrones."
35702270,havron,"It would take a monumental effort, certainly, but that by no means makes it impossible. The ancient Egyptians managed to build the pyramids with quite primitive technology. I see no reason why a feudal society could not build the Eyrie given enough time and manpower."

*When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.*"

1054425,havron,"Hmm, I'm not convinced that doesn't just make it sound like the two of them were fighting. I'm sure it's well known that the two of them have a less-than-ideal relationship.

Regardless, even if they do believe him, I still wouldn't call eyewitness testimony ""hard evidence"". That term should be reserved for physical proof."
11496896,havron,"When Tyrion confesses his ""crimes"" at the Eyrie in Season 1. Still easily the funniest scene yet, and definitely the best moment invented for the show. I was laughing so hard."

29345992,jymhtysy,"Still, 25. I get that not all characters have a Littlefinger jetpack, but there should definitely be enough time.

Although.. I heard somewhere that HBO is pushing for more seasons, but D&amp;D don't agree. I'm definitely not sure though."

43872058,jymhtysy,"I have a feeling the Sand Snakes are suddenly better because they aren't on the limited schedule that they got in the Water Gardens. Meaning, they can have more retakes and stuff. "

dude."
27968547,jymhtysy,"I still have a hunch that Westeros and Essos are connected further east and north. Like, the Lands of Always Winter are connected to Essos's eastern side, which we don't get to see the full extent of on the maps."

49642913,jymhtysy,But she *is* dumb...
48139112,jymhtysy,Uh. Either Lorath or Norvos. I do know that Lorath is apparently the least important/unique Free City.

45605989,jymhtysy,I don't get it... is the theory disproven now? Since they apparently need a new actor.
44029846,jymhtysy,"Huh. Well, the wiki doesn't say if it has any negative reprocussions, but I'm pretty sure Lysa's was caused by that."
48142642,jymhtysy,&gt; :|
28397546,jymhtysy,"Because it was cheap and dampened the effects of the Red Wedding. Also, D&amp;D don't feel like hiring more actors. Or finding new sets. "
29988578,jymhtysy,"Yeah, it kinda would be... to be honest, Ramsey is a pretty expendable character, now that Walda's pregnant."

Bran didn't live with unicorn people.
Arya didn't live with unicorn people.
Sansa didn't live with unicorn people.
Robb didn't live with unicorn people.

But Rickon *did* live with unicorn people. Your argument is invalid.

(Is he even living with cannibal unicorn island people in the show?)"

okay"
38788118,jymhtysy,I certainly don't remember b-list news networks threatening to ditch the show.

Which ones?"
43869282,jymhtysy,"And him becoming a maester. 

I mean, I didn't want to watch the scene, but it was there for a reason. Just like Ramsay/Sansa's wedding night."

That's not character development, that's just a sudden, terribly steep change in personality. Yes, I'd really like to see Cat alive again, but does she really make a difference except kill random Freys and the occasional Podrick or Brienne? She serves no greater purpose, and is a stereotypical zombie overlord. Stoneheart has no redeeming qualities other than being Catelyn Stark when still alive. Overall, boring character. We can just keep hesitantly cheering until she kills enough people so that everyone hates her and she still has no effect on the main story.

So like. Yeah. :("
30074752,jymhtysy,"Not necessary? I myself was beginning to forget how terrible Ramsay is. How are they supposed to get married without consummating later. It's not something to gloss over, especially since this is Ramsay we're talking about. What else is supposed to happen? Seriously, think of something else that might've gone down successfully in Winterfell during the wedding, which at the same time gives Theon and Sansa's characters proper payoff. You know, if it was actually Jeyne Poole in this scene, I doubt anyone would've cared as much and would be focusing on how shitty the Sand Snakes are. There are plenty more reasons than ""shock value"" (production costs, casting, REASONABLE STORY PROGRESSION, making us remember why we hate Boltons, etc.) and it wasn't as bad as the source material. Jaime&gt;Cersei scene was universally frowned upon since it never existed in the books. Just because none of us wanted to see this happen doesn't mean it automatically stops making sense. "
31625812,jymhtysy,"We'll see by the end of the season, so I'll reserve any judgement before that. It could very well be a collaborative effort.

He'll reclaim his name (which finally happened in ADWD), and he'll have to pay the iron price to achieve everything from being nothing.  In the books he missed the kingsmoot, so he's the only one who can dispute it.  He'll gain supporters by showing he's a true ironborn, and he'll go back to the Iron Islands to kick Euron off the Seastone Chair and become the leader of the ironborn.  It could be one of the most dramatic, epic redemption arcs of the whole story.  I've been saying that since ASOS, and so far all of the events through ADWD support that.  So if that's how its going to go, the ironborn will definitely be in the show more (otherwise why even introduce them at all).

20658490,kjhatch,"I've been working with spoiler tagging on Reddit for longer than Alien Blue has existed.  Reddit has never provided CSS support, and all spoiler tagging on Reddit has been about using CSS to fake the tagging effect native to most forum systems. Originally, when subreddit first tried to bring spoiler tags to Reddit, the markup link was altered with CSS in a variety of inconsistent ways.  Different methods worked with varied levels of success on different browsers, and it was mostly a mess.  I was tired of that when I reworked the tagging here back in 2011.  For the first version I pulled examples of tags from every subreddit using them I could find and took the best bits of each as a baseline, and from there tweaked the code till it worked for all browsers.  That style slowly became the most common on Reddit, and when we changed from the / to # to better support mobile users that change also spread.  The way tags are done here *is* the Reddit standard.  I've seen my code copy-pasted in dozens of other subs.  

The original link switch for tags was commonly /s or /spoiler.  /s was shorter and easier, which is why it was used here.  Most subs only needed one tag, but there has always been a need for multiple.  From the very beginning this sub had /s and /b for show and book spoilers.  I know /r/thewalkingdead and /r/lost were both prominent back then with multiple tags too.  Not all subs used /s even then, but all tags started with a ""/"" for the link, and most put the spoiler in the title attribute.  

So when Alien Blue comes along and only supports ""/s,"" they got it wrong from the beginning.  I personally tried to document the variants and explain the need to support what already exists on Reddit in multiple subs.  It was a while after the change to # for touch screens that Alien Blue added ""#s"" support.  **All Alien Blue has to do is tag by ""/"" and ""#"" not ""/s"" and ""#s"" to add support.**  It's that simple, and they won't do it.  

&gt; You would have to go through each sub's custom commands and write the code into the app to work like other spoilers, which is too hard or time consuming for all of them it seems.

That's their argument, which is a weak lie.  I've worked as an application programmer for well over a decade, and most of the time it was working with other programmers' old code that needed updating.  The only way it's ""too hard"" is if their code is a complete mess.  

&gt; There are 2 spoiler commands that work site wide, that a couple of the apps use, that appear as the black bar spoilers like in this post. The green/red bars that this sub uses are specific to this sub only, are therefore don't work on any app that I have tried so far.

Multiple spoiler tag use is common on Reddit.  Just for a very easy example, go to the list of subs on /r/television and visit them all.  Notice how many use multiple tags, and how some don't even use ""s"" for any of them.  I don't see why you're saying that when it's blatantly not true.

What apps have you tried then?  Baconreader, Reddit is Fun, and Reddit Sync are by far the most recommended every time I see someone ask for suggestions.  They all work fine.   Reddit Sync makes all spoiler tags variants blue.  Baconreader and Reddit is Fun both make them all black.  Just to be 100% sure they still have support, I checked current versions of all three just now with the Mod message stickied to the top of this sub.  It has both show and theory spoilers tagged in the OP text, and the different spoiler tags worked in all three of those apps.

16329620,kjhatch,"The War of the Five Kings did more damage to the Riverlands and Westerlands than all the wildlings could do in years of running around free.  For the sake of argument, assume the wildling army was truly 50K strong and the wall didn't exist, so they were all able to just move on through.  They don't have horses, most have little training, and they're traveling with wives and children, their old and their sick, without support from anywhere. There are no supply lines feeding their army as it moves.  Even striping every town they come across will still mean starvation if they don't break up and look for food and shelter separately.  And one they break into more manageable bands, the local garrisons can take care of them.  Ygritte was in awe at seeing the run-down holdfast structures south of The Wall; the wildings have no idea what a real keep or castle looks like, let alone how to attack one.  Sure they'll be hunting game in the woods and travel on roads would become more dangerous for a time, but they won't destroy any serious infrastructure, and over time they'll either have to assimilate or be killed.  

In contrast, by the time Robb made it through the Twins and started clashing with the Lannisters he had 24K troops.  The comments on the Lannisters Riverlands battles and Edmure's efforts to raise troops shows the Riverlands were fielding at least another 15K aroudn that time.  Tywin started gathering troops much earlier, which was why his army was larger.  References in the books put it at 35K; the show upped it to nearly 60K.  So that whole region has already been demolished by armies twice the size of all those wildlings.  They've already eaten through towns' supplies, killed plenty of locals, and burned crops to prevent resources falling into enemy hands.  And that's just the troops fighting in the Riverlands.  The Reach, Stannis, and Ironborn all had their fights as well.  The whole point of the title ""A Feast for Crows"" is all the ""vultures"" benefiting from the post-wars devastation.  

Read through [this thread](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/66106-house-army-numbers/) for examples of the hundreds of thousands of troops the rest of Westeros could potentially muster, and remember how many do have training, real weapons, and armor, let alone the local support.  The Red Wedding took Noble leadership from the North, crippling their ability to hold together a large army, but once they lost, thousands of troops made their way back to their homes.  Those thousands of experienced soldiers are the ones defending their people when any wildling groups attack.

&gt; hordes of wildling raiders would've been pillaging the whole of westeros.

That's the real myth.  They're rabble with too few numbers to ever cause real damage.  The Reach alone could easily take them with their numbers.  Dorne's and the Eyrie's armies are also both untouched.  Even if they made it to the Neck, they'd start to encounter foreign environment problems with flora they don't recognize.  Here's another [good old discussion](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/110802-the-true-power-of-the-wildlings/) on this topic.  

The difference with the White Walkers is they they don't need food, water, or rest.  They are an actual army with leadership, not just a collection of individuals sticking together only while it suits them.  Every person killed by a White Walker army adds to their forces, and they fear nothing.  That is a real threat to all of Westeros. That's the only danger to be concerned about for the rest of the story."

He's been raised in hiding and trained to be a king in order to take back the Crown.  He's the one Tyrion meets on his way to Dany.  There's also a theory that he's a Blackfyre Targaryen who's been told he's Aegon, which honestly makes more sense than real-Aegon suddenly being alive.  I think pairing Sansa and Aegon is a strangly too-good-it-must-be-fiction type of match, given their ages, backgrounds, and the fact one's been setup/trained by Littlefinger and the other Varys.  Having them end up on the throne together makes for a very stable political Crown that would bring a believable peace to Westeros like really nothing else would.  Even Dany and her dragons burning everyone into submission is a short-term peace.  There's no evidence there will ever be other dragons, and the public will not love her like they can Sansa.  Aegon brings all of the Targaryen heritage to the table like Dany, but his education is far more important long-term than the dragons.  He should end up on the Throne.

He's not there for Jon's death, and won't be there for the 999th's election.  The point of the Oldtown trip was to make his chain, which is supposed to take years.  Even if Sam just drops Gilly+baby off, runs to Oldtown, and ""omg I found this important thing to take back to the Wall"" back to Castle Black, he's going to miss most of the big events.  The Others should attack by then, and it's very likely the Wall will fail and even more of the Watch will be killed.  I don't see any way Sam's return is going to rally supporters who mostly don't know him to make him LC.  

Plus the direction of the show's plot makes it seem more likely Sam will have to leave before Jon gets back.  If that's the case he may just desert to save Gilly (and himself) from the other Watch.  There are a lot of red flags saying Sam's gone and won't be back.   At best Sam might return in the story's epilogue to become the Maester of the new, rebuilt Watch after all the fighting is done.

&gt; His Watch will have ended.

Not to him.  He's not looking for loopholes.  He's the hero looking to do what's right.  If winning the war means leading the Night's Watch to so it, he'll gladly re-accept leadership to get the job done.  He does not care about the Iron Throne, and he's not being set up to take over Winterfell.  That means his ""destiny"" is most likely the Wall with the Watch.  If he survives the big war he can rebuild the Watch and lead for X years into a period of safe stability.  He might just die anyway in the fighting, making the issue moot.

46872871,kjhatch,"""Over taken"" doesn't work for most since the show has changed and compressed much of the plots.  The timeline of the show is roughly in the middle of AFFC/ADWD right now, but some characters have been moved forward and others have been delayed.  The popular notion that the show's already passed the books is grossly exaggerated.  Events have been altered, but the show is not even done with ADWD for most characters.  Here's a vague list based on what's happening to them right now compared to events at the end of ADWD:

* Tyrion - is definitely farther along.
* Daenerys - is behind by quite a few events, but most of ADWD will probably happen by the end of S5.
* Jon - is behind, but should catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Arya - is behind, but her scenes are compressed, so she'll probably catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Sansa - is probably farther along.  Her plot has been changed, but the direction is still the same.
* Bran - will finish catching up with ADWD when he returns in S6.
* Jaime - is changed, but based on the plots he's been merged into he'll likely catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Brienne - is also changed, but like Jaime she's working with merged plots and will be caught up by the end of S5.
* Rickon - is already where he needs to be.
* Theon - is behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Stannis - is behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Cersei and the rest of the KL storylines - are behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Sam - is way behind, and clearly they've greatly altered his upcoming plot.  It's unclear where he's going at the moment.
* Yara and the rest of the Ironborn - are way behind but they should all catch up in S6.
* Doran and the Sand Snakes - are a little behind, but they should be caught up to the big points by the end of S5.

49915116,kjhatch,"&gt;  Jon is being set up to take over Winterfell

I think the writing on the wall points more to Rickon for that.  He's the ""shaggy dog"" in the story. The only reason for his existence at all in the story is to show up at the end, and the only thing that'd be left for him to do is take over Winterfell as the last surviving Stark (who's not doing something else).  And if Rickon's doing that, then there's nothing left for Jon to do.  I agree if the 1,000th election is held after the battles are all done, there's an opportunity for Sam to be back and get elected by the remnants of the Watch, especially if he somehow distinguishes himself in the battle, but for that to happen Jon would have also died in the battle. 

&gt; Robb already legitimized him. That means he has a stronger claim than any of his siblings.

So did Stannis essentially, and that was a stronger offer.  Jon didn't need Rob's letter to establish that, and since Rob was also an upstart King not acknowledged by the Iron Throne, the only people who would care about Rob's word on that are other Northerners.  Jon's legitimacy would need to be established by the Iron throne to hold for the rest of Westeros.  The importance of Stark legitimacy then seems to relate back to Jon being a rallying point for the final battle. The Northerners who know of Rob's letter will follow Jon as a Stark.

Shaggydog's wild-dog actions suggest Rickon will fit in fine there.  The show's simplified plot takes Rickon to stay with the Umbers, where watchers will remember the Greatjon as one of the Stark's strongest supporters.  They're also guaranteed to keep him safe.  What that should be for is simply saving Rickon till the very end of the story when he's in a position to reappear and take over leadership of the North as the remaining Stark heir.  The name shaggydog is a joke reference to that fate.  A 'shaggy dog story' is a very long-winded tale filled with a lot of non-relevant events that finally  ends with a disconnected or anticlimactic ending.  Rickon is the punchline to the shaggy dog tale, because he's probably going to be forgotten and left out of the story till the very end.  He's just there to take over Winterfell/The North when no one else is left to provide end-story stability.

The new KG will also likely not be experienced with leading, my guess is all the new heroes, like Brienne, Sandor, and Loras (and they're all maimed like Jaime).  Jaime was groomed to take over Casterly Rock and has more years of established battle experience than likely anyone surviving but Sandor, and Sandor was never a war leader.

12874837,kjhatch,"&gt; what was the point of TV Cersei making the High Sparrow High Septon? ...she re-establishes the Faith Militant, and why?

She thinks the High Sparrow can be controlled/bought, or at the very least that he might feel loyalty to her for the support she gives.  She wants him in the position so that he can be a weapon she can use against others.  Most everyone is corrupt in some way or another, and with a righteous order bent on cleaning up the town, Cersei can point them at her targets.  And then when they do her dirty work, she's absolved of blame because she doesn't directly control the church.

&gt;  Because she wanted an excuse to imprison Ser Loras for being gay, on account of she doesn't like the Tyrells... Couldn't she have found an easier way to do that?

That's more about the show simplifying the book's plot.  In the book remember Loras is sent off to take Dragonstone, and he's reportedly injured/maimed as a result.  His story arc there is now combined with the Faith Militant, and I assume they will severely injure him in some similar fashion so that the end result is the same.

&gt;  On this week's episode she sends King Tommen, her last living son, to confront the high Septon armed with nothing more than a few Kingsguard against a LITERAL army of people who could easily murder him with no repercussions whatsoever.

She doesn't see the danger, just as she has no idea they can come for her too. She's blinded by her belief that she can ""play the game"" as well as Tywin, and she can't.

Clearly it's you who didn't read them."
53709270,kjhatch,"&gt; it's been just over 2 years between the start of the series and the latest episode.

This is the correct answer.  The timeline in the books has been exhaustively mapped, and there's been no indication the show is ""moving faster"" or has jumped forward.  The subreddit's FAQ also has [a simplified and spoiler-free table of the book timeline](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/faq#wiki_how_much_time_passes_during_each_book.3F) that can be easier to understand if the detailed timeline is too complicated for anyone.  An estimate of ""around 2.5 years"" is fine for the last EP, and by the end of the season it'll probably be 3 years.  

The show is still working through events in the books, and for many characters the show's timeline is not far into the AFFC/ADWD plots.  It's also already been suggested by the casting information that NEXT season will be covering events in ASOS that were delayed.  It also already looks like some events in ADWD are also delayed till next season.  Yes, the show is moving around the order of some book events, but shuffling between the latter books is a matter of only a few months, so time is not that big a deal.  GRRM also often wrote the books' story with jumps back and forth in time as he switched between characters; the show does the same thing for the same dramatic effect.

It's also worth noting that actors' ages in the show often seem to have little relevance to the passage of time or the more realistic timeline in the books.  Many posts have been made about Gilly's baby, the recast Tommen and Myrcella, the apparent age of Sandor in relation to his ""older brother"" Gregor, Tyrion being older than he should be, Dinklage being older than Headly and Coster-Waldau, etc.  Characters made older in the show also sometimes act as young as they are in the books, like Dany and Tommen, which makes sense to keep the books' story going, but it doesn't always make sense for the show-older characters.  The reason for that is it's better to get good actors to play the roles in the show even if the ages/appearances don't always match up perfectly.  "

What that should be for is simply saving Rickon till the very end of the story when he's in a position to reappear and take over leadership of the North as the remaining Stark heir.

ASOIAF is a groundbreaking work with a modern, gritty realism that's gotten GRRM labeled the ""American Tolkien.""  ASOIAF has greatly influenced Fantasy over the last decade with many writers adopting models employed in the books.

Paolini is a very young writer who was able to get Eragon published by a combination of extreme persistence and pure luck.  As a teenage writer he's marketable as more unique, and as a person he's a likable guy who does well with personal appearances.  That combined with his ability to actually finish books got his series published, but that doesn't make Inheritance a quality piece of work.  It's very derivative (some have called it plagiarism), and the characters and story are not really developed past the established references he pulled from. 

There's honestly no fair comparison to make between the series.  ASOIAF is a quality piece of work, and even so it took years before it became famous+mainstreamed.  Paolini was just lucky, and hopefully he'll keep at it and produce much better works in a few years.  "

The show doesn't use them a lot because it can be hard to work with animals and CGI is expensive.  In the books they're very important both as active characters doing things and as symbolic foreshadowing (like a lot of stuff in the books)

[Heavy speculation explaining the relevance of direwolves in the story](#g ""The direwolves were gifts by the Old Gods to mark/awaken each of the Stark children for the epic troubles that were coming.

The [spoiler guide comments on that](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/spoiler_guide#wiki_notes_and_clarifications) as like the ""Everybody Lives"" policy that most communities use.  

Yes, there's the possibility of a ""well that character is not dead yet"" spoiler, but even that's not assured.  A character could have died off camera at any point, and even if they are back, they could be back as a corpse on a slab, or resurrected, or appearing in a flashback, or a magical dream.  Saying a character appears at any point is no guarantee of anything.

The benefit of allowing name+book and name+season comments though is huge.  We can't have post titles like

without allowing the combination.  It means titles can be descriptive and clear in order to know if it's a topic you might want to click on.

A post removed from a sub is still in the user's history; it's just hidden from the rest of the public browsing the sub.

Yeah I've read that argument a lot.  The problem with it is that it's been months since Dany freed them.  It's unrealistic that a group of fighters proud of their ""best in the world"" identity would just never train again, especially when they're still working as soldiers.  Anyone needing extra training would have received it in those months.  

Then for the sake of argument, pretend there's still a block of Unsullied who are terrible fighters and can barely hold their spears.  It's also terribly unrealistic for all of them to be patrolling the city together.  At the very least they would be split up so only one untrained person would work with others for both safety and training.  That group was also led by Grey Worm, who it's safe to assume would have ""some"" idea how to set up a safe and effective patrol group.

Maybe he failed and got arrested. What if he purposely got arrested because he knew he would be taken to the wall? What if his target was one of the Nights Watch? Only, I thought the Faceless Men charged a lot to kill, so you would think that his target would be someone of importance, but I guess not necessarily. "

Smaug (Intelligent)

Saruman

Wargs (Larger + can be armored)

Ice (Valyrian steel)

Tyrion

Nazgul (Flying + Witch King Magic) Tough one though.

Mag the mighty (Intelligent)

The Mountain (It would be cool to see him and Elendil fight)

Boromir

Bronn in a duel

The Unsullied (Fighting as a unit + shield formation) though the Uruk-Hai are larger and have better armor. This is another tough one.

Brienne

Helm's Deep over Castle Black

Samwise

Children of the forest (Greenseers and Magic)

Theon, not Reek

The Hound

Sauron"
32936938,kutwijf,"Season 4: Aww yeah, Arya is going to become an assassin and get some revenge!

Season 5: Apparently to become a faceless man, you must give up your identity and everything that comes with it. You also can't just go around killing whomever you want."
31301739,kutwijf,It's poor writing/directing if anything.
12900587,kutwijf,This is what I expected and was hoping for.
31129184,kutwijf,"Cersie made it happen to fuck with Margery. This way she could deny having anything to do with it.

Tommen wouldn't because he's a little bitch. He didn't act there because Cersie didn't protest. "
37766974,kutwijf,And his name is *Fast Food*.
8121784,kutwijf,And? He could tell them what happened to him and that he escaped or that he was let go. They got paid already. It's not like they would return him. He is a great smith and would probably fight for them too!
51393357,kutwijf,"I've heard people calling it a ""brutal rape"", and apparently people have quit watching the show over it. My question is: Was she actually even raped on her wedding night? I mean didn't she consent to it? Wasn't it all apart of her plan? She was never going to ""want"" to have sex with him, but she was still willing to, right? Maybe I'm wrong."
4622764,kutwijf,I see what you mean now.
31253046,kutwijf,"Doran is chilling there because of his gout.

Yeah, I was hoping we'd see mote of Dorne than just the water garden.."
53017149,kutwijf,"&gt;Unless you somehow think that Ramsey would have respected her telling him no...

Well we don't know, because she never said no. 

&gt;Ok, this is straight up disturbing that you think her taking her clothes off in any way is good enough for consent unless you're ignoring absolutely all context surrounding the event. I mean we are shown that Sansa is essentially a prisoner, she's locked in a room all day until Ramsey comes at night to beat and rape her. She is covered in bruises and pleads with Reek to help save her, yet you're maintaining that everything is all good and consensual. 

Read my previous comments. I am talking about the scene that caused all the uproar... her wedding night.

12778290,kutwijf,Fresh pasta exists!
2229246,kutwijf,I'd be down or a 3-4h extended edition blu ray release. 
4073692,kutwijf,"Yes, but the weight allows ""Ice"" to be wielded as if it were a smaller blade. I don't get how it's irrelevant. The lighter weight can add speed to a swing, but also allow the user to swing it longer before tiring out."
43285560,kutwijf,"Alright everyone, titties out for Bronn!"
6998072,kutwijf,"Oh, this is good. 

Wouldn't it have been spectacular if that was Gendry that Jorah had knocked out??"
45282157,kutwijf,"You could say that he is only truly interested in power, considering his new found position, and call him a hypocrite."
35010990,kutwijf,This is spot on.
51418335,kutwijf,"""Brutal"" because she was losing her virginity? It's possible that he was rough with her, but we don't actually see anything. We can presume it.

She's very clearly being raped now, but was she on her wedding night is the question. Also, if people are triggered by seeing rape, even if it's off screen, why do they watch a show like Game of Thrones?"
38665277,kutwijf,"By that I meant, I think you are mistaken. 

You are applying modern standards to a medieval fantasy show. On the show, she was not raped. Today you could argue marital rape. Would I call it brutal? No. Not to mention we didn't actually see anything.

There *has* been scenes depicting rape, according to Westerosi standards, but this is not one of them.

&gt;This show has always had sexual violence if you get triggered by that you shouldn't be watching this show and you have only yourself to blame.

-Redelscum"
38715375,kutwijf,"She knew she would need to have sex with him.

I'm sorry that you were raped. I've been sexually assaulted also. The scene didn't ""trigger"" me. 

I'm not saying it isn't offensive to others, only that one: people are overreacting and being hypocrites, and two: people who were triggered only have themselves to blame for watching the show."
21078755,kutwijf,"It would have been nice to see more of Dorne.

Hope we see again at some point: Blackfish, Brotherhood Without Banners, Gendry, Greatjon/Rickon/Osha.

Dany, Arya and the KL lot, feel a bit meh, but they should be picking up.

I'd like to see more of the Greyjoys, but that last scene with Yara left a bad taste in my mouth.

The Sand Snakes introduction scene was too much, too soon. No wonder it's getting so much hate.

Everything else is great. Overall, I'm enjoying the season so far.








"
6923197,kutwijf,"The only fair fight was with Loras, and Loras is a much better jouster. His older brother Garlan is a far better swordsman. Sandor would beat Brienne had he not been weak due to his infection. Her fight with Jaimie wasn't a fight. He would have beat her if he were not malnourished etc. "

8113283,kutwijf,"Mace will hire a faceless man to kill Trant when he suspects he is to be killed.

No, I don't know, but I doubt he will be killed off. He probably isn't as stupid as he seems."
19337482,kutwijf,Almost as enjoyable as the Lannister/Tyrell diner.
8081828,kutwijf,"I found out the same way that he was ""dead"". I didn't think he was dead, and despite what people are saying, I don't think he dies until this next episode. "
17405749,kutwijf,"Well, it was either the Greyjoys or the Martells. They didn't have time for both. It's really about what's most relevant, and then streamlining storylines. Hell, they didn't even have enough time to introduce us to the Snakes before giving us that scene, which was a bummer. Hopefully things get down there."
2708052,kutwijf,"Valyrian steel was not only stronger/durable but also lighter. Take ""Ice"" for instance. It was a massive blade that looked as if it would only be used for executions, but it could actually be wielded in battle."
49868614,kutwijf,"He may get help from Kevan. If Cersie gets any help, it'll be from Qyburn. Littlefinger may help get rid of Olyver, since he's obligated to help Lady Olenna. "
2199407,kutwijf,"I wonder, could he have been taken captive or sold into slavery out of Hardhome?"
8845700,kutwijf,Same here.
51600577,kutwijf,I don't know why they wouldn't just threaten to put a price on your head if you don't pay them back. I mean the faceless men's base of operation is just down the road. Funding someone's enemies seems like a waste of time and money.
45682923,kutwijf,"How about Dany being at the fighting pit the same time Jorah is there? Or the Sand Snacks showing up in the water gardens at the same time as Bronn or Jaime. I mean, is this lazy writing or do they have no other choice due to time constraint."
35054461,kutwijf,"I'm pretty sure it was a real thing, but with priests."
8814604,kutwijf,"Speaking of that, what was the damage? He got cut in the back of his legs, then stabbed in the back, then the gut? I don't remember."
10318701,kutwijf,"I don't think she ever told the Brotherhood that she needed him for sacrifice. 

And anyways, she could keep using leeches, I mean they worked right? I'm not sure his blood is strong enough for her to make a shadow baby, but if so, one more reason not to kill him.

Well he told him ""when you reach Kings Landing.."", because he sent him off in that direction. Did he tell or insinuate to him that he should hide from the Brotherhood? I don't remember. "
21493424,kutwijf,The Duggars seem like nice people too.

17391782,kutwijf,"I don't mind how he died, only that it was too soon. I can get over it because it's for a good reason (plus it was an epic death - not fighting for glory etc, but to save someone) but it's a shame D&amp;D couldn't find another way. "
35724840,kutwijf,"You're trying to apply today's standards to a medieval fantasy show. 

I'm not looking to argue, but I think those arguments hold weight.

She willingly married him. So that is the yes you were looking for. The bedding ceremony is to consummate the marriage. This is normal.

I was pretty sure that she began to undress when he asked her to take off her clothes. "
41276346,kutwijf,Oberyn's account of her as a child made me hate her even more.
41676801,kutwijf,"There were seven of them. Even if they did form one, are you positive they could not be flanked? I mean they had guys on either side of them. Are we sure there wasn't any side entrances to the corridor? 

Maybe they were just overconfident and didn't think a phalanx was necessary? Maybe they've grown soft/undisciplined from visiting the brothels? 

Who knows why they didn't get into formation, but I think it's realistic that they're not perfect, or invincible. "
45178123,kutwijf,"I did remember seeing them in her throne room after they had taken Mareen, but don't recall seeing them since then."
33324786,kutwijf,She drank the punch.

Girls aren't the only victims. People who are strong physically can still be taken advantage of while under the influence of drugs or alcohol."
44174436,kutwijf,So like the guy who cut Tyrion's chains or Tyene happening to have the antidote for that poison around her neck? 
17380579,kutwijf,I just think we need other bad guy who is as good as Tywin was.
12863656,kutwijf,I actually think he was thinking about Brienne when he said it. I don't think Cersie ever loved Jaimie the way he loved her. She is indeed a hateful woman.

I guess maybe it's a little late to introduce him."

51112180,kutwijf,"To be fair, those masters were probably all guilty of conspiring against her. She was already attacked, so it was retaliation/fear tactics. Stannis allowed people to be burned alive because of their faith. "
7008948,kutwijf,"Them running away like that was bad. The Greyjoys being completely omitted from the show is even worse.

But I guess they just aren't important enough. =/"
9925787,kutwijf,"Just re-watched the scene. So there was 7 unsullied vs at least 20 sons of the harpies. The corridor looks 8 or 10 feet wide? There seems to be entrances on the side, not just at each end. How do I explain why the unsullied acted as they do? I don't know. They should have formed a shield wall, I agree. 

I do think that if those pit fighters? were ordered/paid by the masters to kill, they would have continued to fight regardless of the circumstances. They did have numbers on their side. "

32161091,kutwijf,Plus they've already cut out and streamlined so much shit. We might end up getting an 8th season.
7011797,kutwijf,I like your take on the matter.
37476750,kutwijf,"No, you're thinking of the Super Adventure Club. "
12818464,kutwijf,"We want quality special features like behind the scenes, the making of, interviews, bloopers etc to exist first, but also to be exclusive to the dvd/blu ray, otherwise what's the point of purchasing the dvd when HBO uploads special features and specials to YouTube?

33748804,kutwijf,"But did Areo Hotah know? Speaking of that guy, just who does he fight for anyway?? "
3614678,kutwijf,"We were talking Valyrian steel. I wasn't talking medieval times. 

Quality comes first, of course, but I do think that weight played a part. A lighter blade can mean more speed, effecting striking and parrying. Size of course, effecting mobility as well. Length can be nice for reach, but not as effective in close quarters.

If we're talking equal quality material and craftsmanship, I would go with a poleaxe or spear. Otherwise I'd go with a rapier and ring guard parry dagger.

6985280,kutwijf,"I slightly agree with two points and I'll tell you which.

The unsullied should have been more effective, but they were surrounded and more importantly overwhelmed. 

I did sort of get the same feeling of the guys going in one at a time, but opon re-watching, it seems more reasonable. Selmy leads the fight and turns to block, strikes, uses a guy as a shield, turns to block, strikes... this is actually pretty realistic to how you would fight if you were being attacked from all sides. You assume that more than one person at a time is going to attack you. I think you are being too critical, but you're welcome to your opinion."
44616785,kutwijf,Well that and Talisa. Then Edmure. But it all started with Catelyn taking Tyrion before contacting Ned.

Let me explain, ""thugs"" can still be a threat when in numbers. This guy wasn't in an open field fighting in armor, he was in a small space, surrounded by dudes trying to kill him. Selmy saw he was outnumbered and still ran in anyways. I can't believe people are mocking him."
53110932,kutwijf,"&gt;Well I would assume so, given that she knows that he literally hunts girls who bore him. Sexual assault isn't too big a stretch after finding that out.

She doesn't *know* that anything that Myranda says is true. She just knows that Myranda is trying to scare her, because Myranda loves Ramsay. So in that context, one could imagine that Sansa might believe it is made up, but who knows!

&gt;I dunno man, I just don't see how it is anything other than rape. **Sansa seems pretty clearly horrified by what Ramsey does to her** but is forced to do so anyways under the implicit threat of violence. That's pretty much the definition of the act. 

What did he do to her? 

The thing is, she was going to have sex with him before the Theon bit. Ramsay saying ""don't make me ask again"" could imply violence. *We* know it might, **but Sansa might not**. So, Sansa either gets over the fact that Theon is there and is willing to go through with the sex (all apart of her plan to accomplish her goal) or she does it only under threat of violence (which would be marital rape, but that does not exist in Westeros)

So at worst, we see a scene with (off screen) sex (even if it's actually rape, it isn't according to the show) and hear pain of a women who is losing her virginity. This is what all the uproar is about? I'm trying to understand.

I mean Theon actually got raped by two women (on screen) while saying no.

28562353,kutwijf,"What the does that have to do with anything?

You can milk your prostate without having to stick a dick up there."
34074066,kutwijf,That and she should know Oberyn would not want her to hurt Myrcella.
8826022,kutwijf,This is what I was thinking.
5403002,kutwijf,"That, Deadwood and Boardwalk would've continued and been finished properly if it wasn't for HBO cutting them short."
6942151,kutwijf,"It's clear that people think his death wasn't a good one, but I strongly disagree. "
12921196,kutwijf,"She did it to attack Margery via her brother and not have it come back to her. Just like when she is questioned about his imprisonment, she basically says she isn't holding him prisoner. So like proxy warfare.

But yeah, the high sparrow can't be bought and he is *not* on Cersie's side. She has basically opened up a can of worms here, which could put her son in danger, and all over a grudge.

She thinks she is so clever too. "
43284378,kutwijf,What I don't get is that Cersie always has at least 4 guards with her. Where were they here? 
37796340,kutwijf,"4, 3, 2, 1"
2711003,kutwijf,Meth Gendry.
41199193,kutwijf,Remember the flashback scenes? She's even insufferable as a child. 
31268905,kutwijf,"No, no, maybe, yes, no, no, no, maybe, no, no."
40869429,kutwijf,You won't believe she's not the queen mother!
12882629,kutwijf,Exactly. They are coming off of last year (which has probably been the most impactful) and trying to build things up again. People are being over critical and whiny.
31382123,kutwijf,"But isn't that a polearm? I don't think It's an axe, but I could be wrong."
33713008,kutwijf,?
21263329,kutwijf,"Basically too many focus points and not enough time to go around. Under the circumstances, I think they're doing pretty good. "
52558525,kutwijf,"&gt;There was no consent.

Can you explain, because I thought there was."
32016714,kutwijf,I feel the same way. wtf indeed.
16780941,kutwijf,"Pretty much. Just another reason why I enjoy the show. The ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" are still human."
47329480,kutwijf,Exactly. That scene seemed to confirm it. 
22848680,kutwijf,A ballista on some type of swivel device that could also be cranked up and down.
33023865,kutwijf,"Watch the first 4 or 5 episodes. If you if you aren't hooked by then, it's probably not for you."
37158565,kutwijf,"Different sure, but if people die on the show, It's safe to assume they will die at some points in the books."
48082566,kutwijf,I love seeing how much she is enjoying herself with the role.
12953407,kutwijf,"I get what you are saying, also careful for spoilers please, but none of the scenarios would do sadly. Having him be apart of the high sparrow/faith militant storyline kills two birds with one stone. "
19679611,kutwijf,How Stanissesque of a response.
17319939,kutwijf,I'm surprised he didn't molest her tbh. I mean he put his hands on her like it was normal. I wonder when Viserys came up with this plan of his. 
45016451,kutwijf,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps0Ld0xDo6Q

He's still a captive of Walder Frey as far as I know."
32163436,kutwijf,"True.

I think it would've been better had she already slept with Littlefinger, then we could get behind her ""playing Ramsay"" but as it stands, she has been acting like KL Sansa, apart from the Bathtub scene with Myranda. Which was awesome btw."
35695706,kutwijf,"I've seen people say that it's feminist rape, not actual rape. Why? Because she agreed to marry him, it's the bedding ceremony, she starts to undress when asked, and never says no. Just because people don't like the idea of having sex with someone, doesn't mean they don't consent to the sex.

We as the viewer need to remember its a show that takes place in another time.

To each their own though. "
31341216,kutwijf,"Cool dude. I haven't seen the Wire yet, but thx for the spoiler."
35403769,kutwijf,Revenge. Maybe power at some point.
45172883,kutwijf,"Well he *was* a kid, what did you expect? 

The adults are the ones who are supposed to know better."
19690000,kutwijf,Sacrificed himself so that his brother might get some chocolate kisses.
7994446,kutwijf,"Dany makes dumb decisions. Dorne is meh, so far. Kings Landing is not as interesting as previous seasons, but I think this will change in the next few episodes. Greyjoys being cut out was shitty. I would have liked to see more from certain characters that have ""gone missing"", but they're just not relevant atm. Besides those things, everything else on the show is pretty spot on."
6968170,kutwijf,"Tommen has Kingsguard, Lannister guards, and the City Watch.. yet he calls upon none of them to squash this resistance. He won't even do it for pussy. It's absurd."
9026322,kutwijf,"""Advisers"""
12801693,kutwijf,Robert making the eight.
31915872,kutwijf,Man crush
12777531,kutwijf,"With the way things are going, I don't know if Cersie will be in the position to do much of anything."
8842594,kutwijf,"If they did that, would they not just get rushed from the sides? "
12904312,kutwijf,He said something along the lines of that when Sam assumed that he must've been with plenty of women before.
40863365,kutwijf,I always figured white walkers and dragons.
50398002,kutwijf,It was a ridiculous question.
31338650,kutwijf,I'm sure Cersie convinced Olyver to testify. 
32020111,kutwijf,I didn't think so.
8812564,kutwijf,The stones on the eyes are therapeutic.
33350008,kutwijf,Probably with the Reeds or Umbers.
48050290,kutwijf,"Sam was beaten up and helpless. Gilly didn't ask him if he wanted sex. Consent is the presence of ""yes"" not the absence of ""no"". Consent is never implied and not assumed. Gilly raped sam  *triggered* *triggered*"
39241347,kutwijf,Things have become too predictable.
49958435,kutwijf,I meant incentive for them to fight instead of telling the queens that they are slaves.
34818976,kutwijf,"I agree, it wasn't that shocking. I loves Theon's reaction though."
5405595,kutwijf,"He could also binge watch Harry Potter, Star Wars or James Bond."
23151506,kutwijf,"Probably Tyrion, seeing as how he has experience, and Varys can vouche for him."
2220531,kutwijf,Jorah means Dany. Tyrion is probably thinking Cersie.
51103713,kutwijf,Except for aren't there two more books to go?
51147834,kutwijf,Gotcha.
39669863,kutwijf,You don't have to be enthusiastic about sex to consent to it.
41685687,kutwijf,"Besides being trained to fight as a unit, Spartans were also trained to fight solo. Were the unsullied know for that?"
17653656,kutwijf,Gotcha. Thx for the reply.
7072790,kutwijf,Lets hope.
32898243,kutwijf,"Did we not see the ""rape"" because the show runners were worried about offending people? Because that's not the Game of Thrones I fell in love with.

Though, I think how they did it really worked well, focusing on Theon's reaction. "
