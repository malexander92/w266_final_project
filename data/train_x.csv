No hypeless man may watch the season finale!
It is spread through bodily fluids and can also survive in water. Generally people are afraid to even let those afflicted with greyscale touch them.
Maester Who
"I am convinced that there is something going to happen, but if they are going to kill Dany off what about the dragons? And I would love to see her atleast trying to go to Kingslanding/westeros. Maybe it is going nasty with Stannis and Ramsay. We still have Theon and Sansa there."
Whitehills exist in the books as well.
Well put. I agree.
Maybe it was that xD
I don't get it
It was...
"Seriously, where did that meme start?"
"Don't forget Myrcella.

Although it might depend on whether they're using Baratheon-style or Targaryen-style (male uncles before daughters) inheritance for the throne."
"To be fair, those masters were probably all guilty of conspiring against her. She was already attacked, so it was retaliation/fear tactics. Stannis allowed people to be burned alive because of their faith. "
I missed this? When did this happen?
Seriously? What was the point of changing that?
"The love story in itself was very generic, but that wasn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem was that she ate up so much screentime. I'm not against the idea of D&amp;D making Robb the main character of the Northern rebellion subplot, but at least they should have made it more interesting. But no, instead of developping Robb's relationships with his mother, uncles and bannermen they decided to develop his ultimately irrelevant relationship with Talisa."
TIL Faith Militant was actually Windows M.E. upgrade
"Out of the 18 000 that marched south with Robb only about 4 000 men survived (primarily Boltons). Some houses in the North like the Manderlys, the Mountain clans and the Dustins still have most of their strength left, while others like the Mormonts only have something like a few hundred men left."
"She's becoming feral, and I likes it."
"Yeah, same here."
There are other ways...
The world he created is different from the world in the television show.
"More importantly, modern politics 'arguments' are outside [this sub's scope](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/posting_policy).  "
"It would be so very Game of Thrones to show how truly in love Trystane and Myrcella have grown to be, and then to rip that asunder for a new plot."
"Yes, but the weight allows ""Ice"" to be wielded as if it were a smaller blade. I don't get how it's irrelevant. The lighter weight can add speed to a swing, but also allow the user to swing it longer before tiring out."
AKA the DTs
"Yeah, I'll edit it into ""some people"". A poor choice of words on my part."
What Westboro actually hates also applies here too.
"Did Ramsay say he was ""naturalized"" when he meant to say ""legitimized""? He was already natural-born."
"Oh. 

Oh, you. "
Because the regular sparrows don't have the dope.
"Cersie made it happen to fuck with Margery. This way she could deny having anything to do with it.

Tommen wouldn't because he's a little bitch. He didn't act there because Cersie didn't protest. "
"Besides, the Targayens have already set precedent for taking multiple spouses! Aegon the Conqueror himself had two living wives."
"He brought dipping sticks...

They're Dornish."
"&gt;not being naked on tv makes you a bad person

okay"
"I agree his death came too soon, but I'm guessing it had to happen."
"[ACOK](#b ""'Renly offered me a peach. At our parley. Mocked me, defied me, threatened me, and offered me a peach. I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own. Was that his purpose, to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests? When he spoke of how sweet the peach was, did his words have some hidden meaning?' The king gave a shake of his head, like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck. 'Only Renly could vex me so with a piece of fruit. He brought his doom on himself with his treason, but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brother’s peach.'"")"
"&gt; it could make sense.

Only if you discount all the foreshadowing.  There are details in the first book that describe events in book 5.  That's not random at all."

"That can't happen since [ASOS/S4](#b ""That name is an obvious event spoiler""), which is why your comment also needs a spoiler tag in a No Spoilers mod post."
Like the opposite of Batman.
"Not husband's family, her own. That was her own father or uncle if I remember correctly."
"Does he know that he didn't actually kill Bran and Rickon? Uh, yeah?"
"They're mostly just following the books, so maybe your criticism should directed at GRRM?"
thanks for the kind words :)
"Well, there's certainly worse people out there. 

I think your post contains stuff that is  exaggerated and untrue."
"Oh yeah, same here! The best part for us book readers is [ADWD](#b ""in the books, they *almost* collide -- like, he's literally *right there* at one point but she never realizes who he is and they don't interact -- and then he goes and bogs off to join the Second Sons for the gods know what purpose, and you're like what the hell Martin?? I mean, I'm sure it'll all pay off in the next book, but boy was it satisfying to see them finally meet here."") I am genuinely excited to see what happens next!"
Can't blame you really. Without the title's context it could be read either way.
HODOR!
Loras and Renly were both complete caricatures in the show. 
There will be seven seasons. There are 24 episodes left.
What specifically?
Still looked more comfortable than Ned's.
"Really? Who did Catelyn and Pyp's actors play in the show?

Don't forget Meera Reed as ElectroGirl."
The trail? Huh?
LSH is a book character until she actually appears on the show.  A discussion about her must be tagged for book spoilers.
"Damn, you're right. There are very few Essosi characters that I really care about. Well, Grey Worm and Missandei are nice but their annoying romance is really clouding my judgement.

However, I don't think Slaver's Bay will end up being irrelevant. If Dany gets a happy ending, I think she'll visit the place once in a while to check on things. After all, she's stayed there for a while. And her experience from ruling the place will be valuable later on."
"George has no idea what Reddit is. He barely knows how to navigate the internet. When he needs to research something, he has people that do it for him."
"Savior of Castle Black

Honorary Brother of the Nights Watch"
Don't get it.
"Yeah, claiming that GoT's showrunners are sexist towards women is like claiming that the Wire's showrunners are racist towards Whites."
"Probably because she had just chosen to enter into a legal contract requiring the production of an heir, with strong customs regarding wedding nights.  

Their society is not our society.  There are some admittedly shitty things about it that people have to put up with.  But nobody in their society goes around *blaming* husbands for having sex with their wives on their wedding night, as not only expected of everyone but also *required* of nobility.  That kind of moral judgement is not part of their world.

It is part of ours (and it should be!) but you aren't exactly being productive or informative pointing out things in their world that are considered moral crimes by our standards.  That would make for a very long list, and is irrelevant in any case."
"For TV yeah.  The Smaug CGI was better, though also a lot more expensive too."
She also crucified 163 masters. 
"Episode 2: During Gilly's reading lesson, she asks Shireen about the disease that caused her face to appear as it does, and we learn that two of Gilly's sisters contracted it and they were quarantined and ultimately taken out into the woods and, it's implied, left to die (or perhaps something more sinister).

Episode 3: The Asian female red priest in Volantis mentions it (in Valyrian) during her sermon, and Tyrion comments about it (in the common tongue) saying, ominously, ""Stone men. Good luck stopping the spread of greyscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague.""

I don't recall if it was mentioned in the first episode."
"""No godless man..."""
"I completely agree.  A while back I figured out how to calculate plot armor.  If a character isn't necessary to move the story forward, they can die.  If their death would create a dead-end that makes having told this story thread pointless, they won't die.  So for example, Bran has plot armor because if he died you'd have to ask why so many chapters were wasted on his journey North; it would be *bad writing* to have done so.

I don't think Bronn is needed in the books or the show.  He was given his ""happily ever after"" scenario and then dragged back away from it into the fray."
"For me, it's the shape of Westeros. It's kind of a perfect rectangle, and it's painfully obvious that GRRM picked a random sheet of paper and tried to fill it up as much as he could. "
"Probably ""advisor"" with respect to his court."
"Tommen: I'm going to go consult with my advisors.

"1. Could you elaborate?

2. The only ones who came back for another season after their deaths that come to my mind are Charles Dance, Jason Momoa and (if he counts) Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson. Dance and Momoa had just one scene to film. That's hardly comparable to Kit having to (presumably) film dozens of scenes."
I have never heard it before and tried to hide my laugh at work. ;)
"""Stannis is the finest military commander in Westeros""

Littlefinger dropping some respect up in here."
"What he should have said was ""of course he's seen me naked, he was my squire.  His job was to help me out of my armor and to draw my bath.  Just about every squire has seen their employer naked at some point.""  Boom.  Case closed, everybody goes home."
"[ADWD](#b """"Aegon"" is a Blackfyre, almost assuredly. Neither of them wanted to see Viserys or Dany sit the throne, that's for sure."")"
"D&amp;D have confirmed that Littlefinger doesn't know much about Ramsay. Which is really out of character for him, but oh well. "
Yup.
"This is why I was unhappy with the change from how it was done in the books.  The book version of the vote, Sam basically tricked the other candidates into throwing their votes to Jon as part of a complicated multi-round voting strategy."
"No glove, no love."
What? When did you see the guy masquerading as Jaqen in the show ever slit anyone's throat?
Red Shirts
It is known.
"Or Stark blood, to be honest."
Try /r/earthoficeandfire for stuff like that.
"Thanks to this sub, I now want to see Gendry, in a background shot, with his fucking head on a pike."
killing roose is literally the worst thing anyone can do for the welfare of everyone at winterfell.
"The followers of the MFG would say that all gods are facets of the MFG.  But to the ironborn the Drowned God is a single, separate entity.  As far as the story goes both could be right from their perspectives, and we'll probably never get any hard confirmation anyway."
Toxic. Worse than the WoW community.
I have come here to pour wine and kick ass... and I'm all out of wine.
"I like the Winterfell theme, not sure if it's also called the Stark theme."
"No, they are just priests of the Many-Faced God, and like other priests in the story they have magic."
Just another inconsistency to add to all the rest.
A homemade beverage if there ever was one.
"""Serve my Lord"" is Melisandre speak for ""gonna tap dat."""

Theon died a long time ago... Well that is funny we had the exact same comment ;D
"Allister, like Stannis, respects Jon for not backing down.  "
"Yeah, good shows always have slow moments for character development, but they have always been worth it in both shows. Breaking Bad was phenomenal. The best TV drama I've ever seen, perhaps alongside Six Feet Under. Have you seen that?

Also, Amazon Prime is a great deal. Might be worth renewing. If only Adventure Time were free to stream on it. As is, it looks like it's $1.99/episode, which is absurd given that they're each only 11 minutes long. But man do they manage to pack a lot into those 11 minutes."
Margaery doesn't really do any politicking in the books. Cersei's biggest enemy is her own paranoia.
"True, if you were paying him, he'd be an unstoppable beast who would decimate anyone in your path. Only downside is that it could turn an entire Kingdom against your family."
"Only in the show. That word is not used in the books. The guy that they burnt actually tried to cut a deal with the Lannisters and give them Shireen as a hostage, and *that's* why he was punished, not for being an 'infidel'."
"&gt; But wouldn't that be fun?

Oh.
Um

Absolutely not. I'd like to see it happen after the show, though."

"Hard evidence? All Bran would have is his word regarding what he saw, which doesn't prove anything. He could be easily dismissed as a child with a fanciful imagination."
Not in any of the books published so far.  I doubt she ever will.
"I dunno. I think it should be used in the episode where winter actually begins, which is probably going to be S5E10."
I don't think that's the one. The one being talked about was a private reading.
"In the books, Sansa was much more horrified to be marrying Tyrion.

He said that to Cersei.  Ellaria wasn't there.  Is everybody assuming that all the characters in the show are watching the show?

"It's not going to happen that way, but I like it.  Reminds me a bit of the *Pern* series by Anne McCaffrey, in that you get multiple novels in before realizing it's actually hard sci fi instead of fantasy.

Actually this could be the loose basis for another fantasy novel entirely."
"""Mid execution eye fucking"" is as good a way to put it as any."
"Yeah, you kinda were."
Barristan is the best.
"Uh....

UHHHHH..........

Myrcella? I can't think of any male relatives to the Baratheon family other than Stannis.
What about the other Lannisters? Are they allowed to claim birthright?"
Because they were following the books in Season 1.
"Thorne knew that whatever his mislike for Jon, he's the legit Lord Commander.  He's not going to side with anyone who openly defies and insults the LC, no matter who it is.

Janos fucked up."
Right back at ya.
"I think we need to get some time with the characters before we get the big backstory monologue, so that we care.  Plus, I'm pretty sure the other SS's know Obara's story by now, whether I could kinda see Stannis having never talked to Shireen about her disease before now.  Because I already know him.

It's classic clumsy writing to *start* with the big speech to introduce the character.  Show them being badass, get the audience invested, and *then* give us their big speech about where they come from and what they care about.  Then it'll actually hit home."
And she's fine as hell.
Working with Littlefinger? What?
Wow. So apparently this entire sub agrees that it prefers Joffrey over Tommen *and* Ramsay.
"This needs to be a thing. GoT Monopoly is available, and Risk will be coming out soon.

Great job btw!"
"I would say the biggest vacancy is the portrayal of the effects of war that was featured so heavily in a feast for crows. The book made a strong case against revenge, especially from characters like Ellaria, who has been turned into a psycho rage-monster and child-murderer in the show. Everything is about revenge, lust for power, and boobs."
"Agreed, but that is not the question ;P"
Step 1: have Maisie William's face...

"Who cares about the outrage. Those people don't have to watch the show!

I thought it was a great episode for the most part. "
"It's popular from the books.  If you want to discuss it in full, as you've described, you need to include a book spoiler warning title tag too."
"Because 

1. Jon didn't know about Rickon, just Bran.
2. The only place Bran could have gotten to before freezing was if he stopped off at Craster's.
3. Jon looked at Crasters and didn't find Bran.  Then he burned it down.

As far as Jon could know, Bran is dead.

I would like to take this moment to remind everybody that the characters in the books haven't read the books."

"Apart from the two mentioned, Pod killed one of them during Blackwater and they probably didn't replace him. I think the Hound was (unofficially?) named to the Kingsguard after Ser Barristan was fired, and I guess maybe they forgot to replace him too.

That still leaves one though. Maybe he was standing outside on watch duty so that they wouldn't all be taken unawares and killed if someone threw a grenade inside the room."
Nothing
"Yep, they did ;P"
"It's probably a show mistake, but it would make sense that Cersie would fill the spots as necessary to have protection for Tommen."
Anyone got a backup? Link is dead.
The direwolves are often mentioned in the books and play important parts in the story.  The show has reduced their significance greatly. 
"Yeah, seriously: Don't just tag screeners with an easily-blurrable name in the corner; instead, hide subtle details in specific scenes, or drop random frames, or anything else that would be nearly impossible to detect a priori but easy to verify for those in the know. Make it hard for people to be sure they won't get caught leaking these eps."

"I haven't read the book where this event happens yet and I'm a Jorah lover aswell (if that is a right name for it...), but I don't see why people think that Tyrion will be able to help Jorah out. Dany doesn't want Tyrion to be a advicer or her king? I don't think she really likes the Lannister, ritgh? But he is an amazing speecher so maybe  he will be able to get some things and he did kill his father. But Jorah will probably not be killed not by her hands. From the moment he stept in that fightingpit you could just see that Dany know it was him, or atleast though of it, and she looked proud when he slaid those men without blood. "

"IMDB's information has no bearing on anything ""real"" for the show.  Anyone can edit the information, and it's less policed than Wikipedia.  Browse each cast list by episode and notice how actors are often listed when they did not appear in those episodes.  There are also many actors never listed who do appear in important roles.  And IMDB is also prone to trolling/pranking edits when people want to make drama.   It's unreliable and not an authority on future episode information."
"Winterfell is just the main castle for the nobles, their support staff, any soldiers, etc.   In the lands around the castle are the smallfolk who farm the area, have shops, and provide the goods that support Winterfell.  They're likely staying at an inn in the town outside the walls."

This is an all spoilers scoped thread.  Go nuts.

At this point Stannis.

"This is character development. 

Sansa has always been a survivor not a player. This is pretty much the first time since Season 1 that Sansa has to rely on herself and make her own allies. When she was in King's Landing characters like the Hound, Tyrion and Shae came to her aid. Now the only person inside Winterfell that was helping her is dead, and she has to (presumably) take advantage of Theon's guilt to make him help her.

It's certainly more interesting than her Qarth arc or her relatively easy conquest of Slaver's Bay. Emilia Clarke's performance is also better than in previous seasons.
"If Roose wins:

1. Take the North. 2. Marry Sansa and declare her the Queen of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale. 3. Kill the Lannisters.

If Stannis wins:

1. Swear fealty to Stannis. ?. Maybe ask to be married to Sansa. 2. Attack the Lannisters. 3. Get rid of Stannis (and Shireen). 4. Declare Sansa as the Queen of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale."

He's been cut from the show like so many others. He is supposed to be a vital part of Jaime's arc but that isn't going to happen now.
"I love Pyat Pree's story in the books because if you pay attention, you realize that he and three other warlocks were captured by Euron-motherfucking-Crow's-Eye leaving a ship from Qarth, and he killed one and fed him to the other three.

Whether you want to bring in the Syrio=Jaqen theory or not, part of the speculation about Jaqen is that he was there to travel with Arya, to get to know her and evaluate her.  The theory is that the Faceless Men had a vision/prophecy about Arya, perhaps like that the Ghost of High Heart saw too, and Jaqen was sent to test her for a possible invitation to join the Faceless Men."")

That person with her in the shot from the trailer is Tommen. And Olenna has absolutely zero authority over Tyrell soldiers.
"[The events in AGOT alone cover 1.2 years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/faq#wiki_how_much_time_passes_during_each_book.3F)  Season 1 follows that timeline very closely.  With the events in the last episode and upcoming, the show's at about 2.5 years."

"The Unsullied aren't supposed to be badass 1-on-1 fighters.  On a battlefield they make a really badass unit because they never break ranks.  Any battle is far more about getting your opposing side to turn and scatter than it is how many people you kill.  Once one unit breaks ranks, the other can mop up its individuals easily.  The thing that makes the Unsullied scary good in battle is that no matter of many of them you kill, the rest will re-form their line and keep working as a unit.  Long after any other army would have given up, shit themselves and ran off in random directions.

However, this doesn't translate to policing narrow streets in small groups."

"Oh yeah, totally. That episode of Breaking Bad was well worth the character exploration. I enjoyed it, even despite my own ADD. =P

Yeah, I'm pretty much the same way. I usually only get into one serious drama at a time, but I do tend to watch a mix of lighter shows alongside. My usual pattern is one big drama and one more lighthearted cartoon as a ""chaser"". Too much heavy drama can weigh you down emotionally, so coming up to breathe a little joy is definitely helpful. And as for the drama series, I have actually found that taking your time to digest each episode is well worth it to give yourself time to mull over what you just saw, pick apart the details, and theorize about what might happen next (plus it makes the experience last longer). I love the weekly wait for new Game of Thrones episodes for just that reason. But, oh boy, when I'm catching up on a new show that's been on for a few years, you bet your ass I don't have the discipline to do that, haha. I'll just marathon it a few times in a row to catch everything. But, the new seasons are so much more rewarding due to the pacing. I generally watch the episode as it airs, think about it, come here on Reddit and chat with everyone about it, then watch it again right before the next one. And of course I periodically go back and rewatch entire seasons to fill in any lingering blanks I may still have, as well as giving myself a chance to catch any foreshadowing I didn't see before since I didn't know what was going to happen (and believe me, there is a fair amount of it, and it's so satisfying to notice in retrospect). But yeah, go ahead and binge watch Six Feet Under (I did). It's not like anyone can stop you. ;)

Of course not. The Battle of Castle Black spans four chapters in A Storm of Swords and lasts for over a month. You just finished the first of those chapters. Alliser Thorne and giants are definitely part of the battle and it is thoroughly more epic and also more realistic in the book. 
"""Question about Tyrion during the battle"" for example.  That with the [S2][E9] tag gives plenty of context to people who know the episode without specifically saying any events.  That title isn't even saying Tyrion is *in* the battle; he could be far from it and just watching it for example.  That way the actual details are in your real question inside the OP text and under that [S2][E9] warning for safety."

"Because recast actors look different.  I [just commented on that](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/37y12o/tv_how_much_time_have_passed_since_events_of_s01e1/crqu5oy) in the timeline post from a few hours ago:

&gt; It's also worth noting that actors' ages in the show often seem to have little relevance to the passage of time or the more realistic timeline in the books.  Many posts have been made about Gilly's baby, the recast Tommen and Myrcella, the apparent age of Sandor in relation to his ""older brother"" Gregor, Tyrion being older than he should be, Dinklage being older than Headly and Coster-Waldau, etc.  Characters made older in the show also sometimes act as young as they are in the books, like Dany and Tommen, which makes sense to keep the books' story going, but it doesn't always make sense for the show-older characters.  The reason for that is it's better to get good actors to play the roles in the show even if the ages/appearances don't always match up perfectly.  "
"&gt; Stannis's own bannermen flocked to his younger brother

That's flat out wrong.

Stannis was Lord of Dragonstone, and he had *all* his bannermen.

Renly was Lord of Storm's End, and the Stormlands were sworn to him. Yet it was some of *his* bannermen went to Stannis instead. And after he died, even more did.

Robert gave Renly Storm's End, so Renly had about 15 years to make friends with everyone in the Stormlands."

She willingly married him. So that is the yes you were looking for. The bedding ceremony is to consummate the marriage. This is normal.

I was pretty sure that she began to undress when he asked her to take off her clothes. "
"Oh, I know. "
I don't know either.
People hate Brienne? I though she was quite funny with Pod.
And people are saying that Dany never got raped. 
"Also apart from the scar, Tyrion is described as being quite ugly in the books."

Wait how do you trigger that image linker bot?"
"Would be kind of hilarious if Brienne keeps waiting for a candle to light up, and it doesn't, and after a few months Brienne is like, ""Well, I guess Sansa doesn't need me after all, time to go."""
If you count all the characters which appeared briefly but then were never heard from or seen again.
"Then what are you doing in a book spoilers thread?? =P

Well, if you don't mind being spoiled, it's from Jaime's penultimate chapter in the fourth book, *A Feast for Crows*. In that book, he is given the task of restoring order to the Riverlands and essentially cleaning up after the war (as /u/ProfessorBinns so eloquently puts it, his ""Bitchslapping the Riverlands Tour""). At this point in the story, the Blackfish holds Riverrun and Jaime has an army composed of former Tully bannermen including Freys (loyal to the Lannisters since the Red Wedding) and a very captive Edmure, who as the Tully liege lord Jaime is trying to get to command the Blackfish to surrender the castle. It's a pretty awesome scene, and this speech that finally gets Edmure to acquiesce is one of my favorites in all the books. Such a badass moment for Jaime, and a real shame to be cut from the show. It would have been so glorious to see on television."
Oberyn was all about revenge.  He just wanted it to be targeted exactly to the right place.
"I hate the phrase 'gave me chills' because it's so overused, but that line in the book indeed gave me chills."
"Well he did look a bit weird, but I honestly don't want to believe it. It would be one hell of a twist.."
"That's great, thanks!"
"What detracted it for me was that Oberyn was consumed by revenge and that he really didn't care who he was fighting for, as long as he faced The Mountain.  "
"I think GRRM himself has said that there's a lot of Tiberius in Stannis. Particularly Tiberius as he was portrayed in I, Claudius."
"The kingsguard listen to Tommen. They were going to act, but he put his hand up."
"She isn't even a Tyrell by birth. She was born a Redwyne and simply married into the family. She has absolutely no kind of leadership position whatsoever. And no, House Lannister is the richest house in Westeros. "
He did show that in A Storm of Swords. Reread Arya's chapters.
They couldn't handle how cool she was.
You pirate!
*Viserys will remember that.*
"Yes, I support Stannis, but I totally get where Loras is coming from. Not to mention, as Renly's chief backers, had Stannis won, the Tyrells would go back to being relatively political outcasts they had become because of siding against Robert in his Rebellion. And also not to mention, Stannis hasn't been fond of the Tyrells ever since they made him, his men, and their families nearly starve to death, so even if Loras and Margaery did go to him willingly, he probably wouldn't give them the good deals that the Lannisters did. They really had no reason to side with him."
Exactly.
I hear that you can gain the technique by touching a certain type of doll.
Because everything any character says is a prophecy that *has to* come true.  There's a point beyond which that stops being good foreshadowing and becomes bad plotting.
"With Ygritte and Mance dead, he's pretty much the only Wildling that the viewers like. Unless of course we meet some decent new Wildlings at Hardhome."

There's been very little of Pycelle in this season. Perhaps it would be smarter to keep him around?
Aaah. Now I get what you're saying. No worries.
"The first part of it is in S04E04, ""Oathkeeper"", in the scene between Sansa and Littlefinger on his ship:

""A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.""
"
At least she wasn't monologuing.
That Obara storytime felt forced. Is this really the first time she's telling the story to these people?
Jaime at least has some modicum of honor left.  And he found humility when he lost his hand.
How do these ratings work? I find it hard to believe that more than half of the reviewers didn't like Seasons 1&amp;2.
They are building things up. I think we are getting a season finale with some very shitty things to happen.

Well based on your [Not sure if spoilers?] title tag, you really need to read through the subreddit's [spoiler guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide).  It's likely a large chunk of your apprehension stems from not knowing how spoiler warnings/tagging works in this subreddit.

Your concern about ""character favorites"" can sometimes be valid, but most of the time that has little meaning for what events really happen in the story.  You say you'd be unsurprised now if Stannis turns out to be a good guy, well what about the many fans of the Boltons?  Some people love Ramsay too, and it's hard to believe he'll turn out the hero.  Character fandoms to not influence the writing of the show or books, so they shouldn't affect your serious expectations either.

&gt;  I did want to ask how other show-watchers navigate this subreddit. Avoid episode discussions?

Most just follow the warnings provides and choose what they want to read based on the tags.  Just carefully avoid the [Book] and [All Spoilers] threads, and you'll be fine.  "

I'm guessing she either had dye or never touched the hair. Or it just hasn't been that long.
Looks like Stannis just died. 
"Theon agreed to fast. If he had really made a change, it would have been dramatic and sudden and triumphant. Instead he said yes, slowly made his way to the top."
"No it wasn't.  They've discussed his broad outline (such as it is, which we don't know).  But that's far from having a detailed schematic of everything."
"This. May I remind my fellow book readers that at the current point in the books [ADWD](#b ""Tyrion has yet to join forces with Daenerys. For all we know, GRRM intends to kill off Barristan before that happens, to create just such an advisor vacuum."") We really just don't know. Let's give the story a chance to develop before we pass judgement, why don't we?"
"The moondoor in the floor was cool.  Arya with Tywin in Harrenhal was better.  The Red Wedding in the show was more dramatic with Talisa there.  I also didn't miss Sam's extended boat travel or the stay in Braavos.  I assume they'll make a ""quick trip"" south on the Kings road using Littlefinger's speedy service to make up for the time.

The combined Sansa/Theon/Brienne plots seem to be an improvement so far too.  I don't miss the Mance/Spearwives that were ridiculous by the end of the escape.  Sansa in place of Jeyne is already greatly improving the impact of the Winterfell events.  And Brienne really is better and more consistent being in place up North than the Riverlands/Jaime plots that seem a lot less relevant now with Jaime down in Dorne.

EDIT: Oh I also did not miss Tyrion's LONG boat ride through Essos. Putting him with Varys and not spending months on the travel time is better.  I do hope they are intending to bring Aegon back in some other way [like this theory](#g ""He'll be Trystane instead""), but so far it's an improvement."
What the fuck.
:( I tried to be ambiguous. Okay i will tag
"The books have Rickon taken Skagos by Osha.  The inhabitants are reportedly savages, but more likely they're simply very tough Northerners who can protect Rickon.  Shaggydog's wild-dog actions suggest Rickon will fit in fine there.  The show's simplified plot takes Rickon to stay with the Umbers, where watchers will remember the Greatjon as one of the Stark's strongest supporters.  They're also guaranteed to keep him safe.  What that should be for is simply saving Rickon till the very end of the story when he's in a position to reappear and take over leadership of the North as the remaining Stark heir.  The name shaggydog is a joke reference to that fate.  A 'shaggy dog story' is a very long-winded tale filled with a lot of non-relevant events that finally  ends with a disconnected or anticlimactic ending.  Rickon is the punchline to the shaggy dog tale, because he's probably going to be forgotten and left out of the story till the very end.  He's just there to take over Winterfell/The North when no one else is left to provide end-story stability.

The boy knows his Dornish houses!
Is Dany's infertility even a thing in the show?
You shouldn't really associate George with anything that goes on in the TV show anymore.
"Just plain awful. Same names but different people entirely. They didn't even try to get their ages, hair colors, or ethnicities right. And they should be having absolutely nothing to do with Ellaria. And they certainly should not want to kill Myrcella. The whole thing is bad fan-fiction at this point. And another thing... Apparently Ellaria is Tyene's mother in the show. Ellaria is not supposed to be the mother of Obara, Nymeria, or Tyene. "
"Theon is weak. Not just mentally but also physically. He's chances of killing Ramsay unarmed are pretty low, and if he'd fail... I don't even want to think about what Ramsay would do to him. Even if he'd kill Ramsay, he'd still need to escape from inside the keep or stay and be flayed by Roose."

"""Over taken"" doesn't work for most since the show has changed and compressed much of the plots.  The timeline of the show is roughly in the middle of AFFC/ADWD right now, but some characters have been moved forward and others have been delayed.  The popular notion that the show's already passed the books is grossly exaggerated.  Events have been altered, but the show is not even done with ADWD for most characters.  Here's a vague list based on what's happening to them right now compared to events at the end of ADWD:

* Tyrion - is definitely farther along.
* Daenerys - is behind by quite a few events, but most of ADWD will probably happen by the end of S5.
* Jon - is behind, but should catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Arya - is behind, but her scenes are compressed, so she'll probably catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Sansa - is probably farther along.  Her plot has been changed, but the direction is still the same.
* Bran - will finish catching up with ADWD when he returns in S6.
* Jaime - is changed, but based on the plots he's been merged into he'll likely catch up with ADWD by the end of S5.
* Brienne - is also changed, but like Jaime she's working with merged plots and will be caught up by the end of S5.
* Rickon - is already where he needs to be.
* Theon - is behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Stannis - is behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Cersei and the rest of the KL storylines - are behind but on track to be caught up by the end of S5.
* Sam - is way behind, and clearly they've greatly altered his upcoming plot.  It's unclear where he's going at the moment.
* Yara and the rest of the Ironborn - are way behind but they should all catch up in S6.
* Doran and the Sand Snakes - are a little behind, but they should be caught up to the big points by the end of S5.

"""medieval Catholic Church"" is not Pope Francis or the modern/current catholic church.  Reasonable academic discussions of religious influences in GRRM's writing are perfectly fine.  The same goes for mature discussions of the use of sex and nudity on the show, but that's just as rare as informed historical commentary.  Instead your post was about:

* ""hey this real world things reminds me of GOT"" - those should be posted to /r/earthoficeandfire instead
* a direct reference to modern religion - always immediately pulled
* the similarity is ""weird/creepy"" - so the comment is likely to cause drama

and any one of those qualifies as outside the sub's scope.  The modern religion is the simplest to explain, which is why I stopped with it earlier.

&gt; we're pretty used to taking offense with a grain of salt

Sadly that's not true for everyone.  The religion was pulled in response to posted issues, just like the politics. It's already proven to be a trigger for drama here.

Though it's far from the original book location of the ruins of Chroyane on the mighty Rhoyne, that is obviously out since Tyrion's riverboat adventure got downgraded to a wheelhouse ride with severely limited face-gazing options, and it just...feels right, somehow.

"[Show speculation and Theon's arc, some book info related to the ironborn](#g ""Honestly I think the show will probably simplify the ironborn like they've done everywhere else.  The kingsmoot, uncles, pirating in the Reach, etc. can all just be boiled down to Balon's eventual death and the ironborn being thrown into chaos.  Without all the backstory, there can be anonymous fighting among the stronger ironborn for control, no one wanting to follow Yara, etc.  The show will just follow Theon instead, and he'll arrive back in the Iron Islands strong and ready to clear out the fighting to bring them to order.  That timing makes more sense with delaying the ironborn plot for another season too. I think in the bigger picture he may be important somehow as leader of the ironborn to assist in the final battle against the White Walkers."")"

"From Victarion's second chapter (""The Reaver"") in AFFC:

&gt;The Crow’s Eye filled two cups with a strange black wine that flowed as thick as honey. “Drink with me, brother. Have a taste of this.” He offered one of the cups to Victarion.
&gt;The captain took the cup Euron had not offered, sniffed at its contents suspiciously. Seen up close, it looked more blue than black. It was thick and oily, with a smell like rotted flesh. He tried a small swallow, and spit it out at once. “Foul stuff. Do you mean to poison me?”
&gt;“I mean to open your eyes.” Euron drank deep from his own cup, and smiled. “Shade-of-the-evening, the wine of the warlocks. I came upon a cask of it when I captured a certain galleas out of Qarth, along with some cloves and nutmeg, forty bolts of green silk, and four warlocks who told a curious tale. One presumed to threaten me, so I killed him and fed him to the other three. They refused to eat of their friend’s flesh at first, but when they grew hungry enough they had a change of heart. Men are meat.”

Then, in Daenerys's third chapter in ADWD (which would be chronologically a bit earlier than Vic's above), a very much alive and not-locked-in-a-vault book-version Xaro Xhoan Daxos warns her:

&gt;“Not all your enemies are in the Yellow City. Beware men with cold hearts and blue lips. You had not been gone from Qarth a fortnight when Pyat Pree set out with three of his fellow warlocks, to seek for you in Pentos.”"
Only with respect the first season.
"I've heard people calling it a ""brutal rape"", and apparently people have quit watching the show over it. My question is: Was she actually even raped on her wedding night?

"[Another point on religion in the books, with speculation](#g ""Oh also having priests misinterpret visions may also be part of their gods' will because their mistakes are still working to advance their god's interests.

So some visions may even be intentionally misleading the priests to put them in the right place at the right time (or of course it's just GRRM moving characters to fit his plot ;)."")

"Yup.

When a new book hasn't been out in a while, people discuss them more and more and when they run out of things to discuss, come up with theories ranging from stupid to great, and all of them very detailed and meticulously written. This was more of a parody of those, a completely absurd theory, but with the same level of meticulous detail as the actual theories. It was so ridiculous, and people appreciated the level of work and commitment to it, that we upvoted it to the top and it spread from there as the ultimate joke theory of the community.

"Needs moar flaying. 

Ned Stark outlawed flaying in the North; Sansa Stark puts it back on the menu."
"Fair point, but I'm not so sure. If you read that chapter in its entirety, it's made pretty clear that, yes, Dany has no choice, but during that passage Drogo ends up being more gentle than she expected and, gradually, she seems to come to decide that, yes, she wants this. Not so much when he repeatedly takes her forcefully later on, of course, but in the end she comes to use her own powers to get what she wants from him. I am hoping that Sansa is able to do so as well but in a different way, manipulating Ramsay until she makes her move and exacts her revenge."
"True story.  They're basically the Lannisters of the North.  Just a truly horrible, twisted, fucked up house that has too much power."
"[Theory about Aegon in the Show](#g ""Aegon is Doran's nephew.  He'd want him protected as much as any Targ/Blackfyre. Aegon spends most of ADWD getting to the Stormlands.  It'd be MUCH simpler to have him revealed in Dorne from the start, and as a character who already has a reason to exist in the world.  It also means not needing all of Doran's other years-long plots to get back the Throne that have also been cut from the show, because he's got Aegon right there.  It's easier to protect and hide a Targaryen in a secure location like that than traveling all around Essos, and it's easier to give him that ""King's education"" that'll theoretically be important later."")  As far as the show goes with how it's dropped many of the book plots, that would make a lot more sense if they are going to include Aegon.

"Yeah, and that happened in episode 6 too. Weird coincidence."
"Haha yeah, that would've been awkward. According to the rumors, that was a primary reason she turned down the role. But, again, I believe these were always just rumors that started simply because his sister just happened to be an actress."
He left his Riverlords to protect their homes. Robb only had ~3 500 Northmen left at the Twins who weren't Karstarks or Boltons.
How could he reveal it? And would he even want to rule?
Oh no.  People on the Internet are complaining about something...
"Van Oster would call in to the DEA office when they didn't come back, if only to find out who the hell was taking the next shift.  At which point they would realize that Huell was the last person to have seen Hank and Gomie alive.  They would then bring him into the office to question him about that and he'd describe his last conversation with Hank.  Then they'd let him go because they actually have no reason to keep him and know of nobody to protect him from.

This is so fucking obvious, it's just a matter of applying ""what would happen if this were actually a real world with its own continuity.""  People take shits that aren't filmed.  When they get in a car in one scene and arrive somewhere else in that car in another, we can assume they drove the intermediate distance in that car.  If someone gets in a boat and is rowing to place X, you can assume after a certain amount of time they got to place X even if you didn't see their fucking boat land.  We don't need our hand held and to see literally every tiny detail on the screen in front of our eyeballs or else we have to assume they *didn't* happen.  That's utterly fucking imbecilic.

Rather, we should assume the *most likely* outcome is going to happen by itself *unless* we see an unusual plot point to change that.  Davos sent Gendry rowing to King's Landing.  Therefore Gendry is in King's Landing.  He's probably working as a blacksmith again, because that's what he tends to do."
"In the show he has a conversation with Sam where they're looking at a map and trying to figure out where Bran could have gotten to, and decide Craster's is the only place.  Then almost immediately the issue with the Craster's mission comes up.  But Jon definitely had two purposes in going there."
Veep is awesome though! Although I started liking it more only season 3 onwards.
"Well at least he didn't marry an old woman, lock her up in her own castle's tower and starve her until she started eating her own fingers."

Bruh. Find a higher quality version, or more simply, just pay up.

Also, if you have an Apple device, you could potentially catch two consecutive episodes on a free trial."
"And it's not even that effective because it's only in the show that they show Stannis to be 'under her spell' so to speak. In the books he looks at both Davos and Melisandre equally, and she doesn't really have a say, and everything she does seems quite transparent to everyone."

All you see is Theon's reaction. 
Time-traveling Targaryen Tyrion fetus theory is LEGIT.
Can we say that it's already....come?
He even looks like Aaron Eckhart.
"The show will finish with D&amp;D as expected.  They know the main points of the ending already.

GRRM has reportedly said if he dies his notes on the remaining book(s) should be destroyed and the books' story never finished by anyone else."
"Actually, including it establishes a good symbolic pattern.  The wolf skin thing was after the fact, and unlike the stag or the fish, not a productive activity."
"[Heavy speculation about Theon's story arc, with book spoilers](#g ""That's important to Theon's arc.  He needs to be as close to truly dead as possible.  The old Theon must be gone in order for the character to come back from the dead like a true ironborn.  He'll have to pay the iron price to achieve everything, and in effect become a living metaphor for the Drowned God's teachings.  He'll rise again, harder and stronger.  He'll take his name back.  He missed the kingsmoot, so he's the only one who can dispute it.  He'll gain supporters by showing he's a true ironborn, and he'll go back to the Iron Islands to kick Euron off the Seastone Chair.  It could be one of the most dramatic, epic, and badass redemption arcs of the whole story.  I've been saying that since ASOS, and so far all of the events through ADWD support that.  He's already using his name in ADWD.  So if that's how its going to go, the ironborn will definitely be in the show more."")

"1. Littlefinger was hundreds of miles away in the Vale when Joffrey died, and had been for months.  Or at least as far as anyone knew.  Due to the presumed distance, he's among the last people anybody would connect with it.
2. Roose has yet to announce publicly that Sansa is up there.  He will soon if he wants to get those wedding invitations out to the northern lords, but afaik he hasn't yet.
3. If push comes to shove, Littlefinger can just tell Cersei that it's an impostor Sansa.  His niece Alayne is pretending to be Sansa in order to help the Boltons bring the north in line.  Littlefinger gets his blood married into the Bolton line in exchange for helping them secure their realm.  She'd fall for it.

"The book explicitly says he did.

""Westeros had seven gods at least, though Viserys had told her that some septons said the seven were only aspects of a single god, seven facets of a single crystal. That was just confusing.

"Those two were set pieces for the season, so they practiced months for it. The regular short fight scenes tend to be underwhelming, while on other shows they do even the short scenes really well.

Maybe they are going for realism or something, saying that real fight scenes aren't exciting, they are just brutal. Still though, there's a lot more excitement when watching Arrow or the original Black Canary do melee combat, which often even makes up for bad plot lines."

Look at the gif above.  The problem with the dagger girl was that she was way too close.  If she were advancing from further back it could have looked more threatening and Bronn could have extended his sword cut instead of pulling in.  But then she would have been out of frame.  That's not her fault, that's on the director.

If you watch the Oberyn/Mountain fight again, you may notice that each film cut lasted on average less than a second.  That scene is Franken-edited together like crazy (to spot actual good fight-scene skills, look for long takes).  It's sad to think that the Sand Snake scene was made from the best footage they had.  The rest must have been laughable.

The problem was that no matter how much money you have, you don't get to use that location for more than they got.  They had 1 week to film all of the Water Garden scenes for the entire season.  Good fight choreography takes more time than that.  Also, the direction for fight scenes seems to really suck this year.  But blaming the actors for that is just silly, and demonstrates a severe lack of understanding of film production."

"The people in Dorne plan to go to war to make Myrcella queen because in Dorne girls inherit over younger brothers.  Somebody tries to abduct her and she ends up with a big scar across her face. 

Another Dornish plan is to send Doran's son Quentyn to visit Dany because they were secretly betrothed when she was born.  He does.  Then he tries to set her dragons free and they roast his punk ass.

There was one guy ""Griff"" who is secretly Aegon Targaryen (Elia's son switched at birth with a random baby by Varys) travelling with a mercenary company who secretly serve a secret bastard line of Targaryens.  Tyrion was travelling with them instead of Jorah.  They play Westeros' version of chess a lot.  ""Griff"" is also supposed to try to marry Dany, I think.

The old king from the Iron Islands falls off his bridge and dies.  His brothers show up.  They have a big meeting to decide who the next king will be.  Much pirate badassery ensues.  Misogynist pirates don't like Asha(Yara) so she charges off on a mission to prove her badassery and immediately gets captured by Stannis.  One of the pirate uncles sets sail to go find Dany with a magic horn that's supposed to control dragons, maybe?  He probably wants to marry her too.

When Tyrion gets to Meereen it's being besieged by ridiculous slave armies from all of the other free cities.  He and Jorah get captured by the same guy and forced to become slave entertainers.  There's a massive outbreak of a horrible disease (not grayscale, but definitely lethal as hell) going on everywhere killing people off left and right.  Nothing happens except suckitude everywhere.

Danny marries Hizdar.  When they open the fighting pits, somebody tries to poison Dany but it didn't work because she wasn't hungry.  Nice plan, assassins.  Then DROGON OUTTA NOWHERE shows up and starts roasting people.  Dany jumps on his back and they fly away.  She hangs out at Drogon's cave for a while trying to figure out how to better control him.  Then she and her dragon meet a horde of Dothraki.

Arya is given a potion that makes her blind.  Then she gets a bunch more training.  Then they un-blind her, after she wargs into a cat to be able to fight without seeing.  She often dreams of being a direwolf leading a giant fucking pack of wolves around the Riverlands.  She then learns how to practice acting as other people, being observant, and coming up with clever plans to kill people.  Then they teach her the face trick.  It involves magic and actual faces cut off of dead people.

Sam, Gilly and Maester Aemon set sail to Oldtown but somehow get stuck in Braavos for way too long.  Gilly's baby was switched with Mance's baby; she has his, and hers was left behind.  She bawls at the top of her lungs for the entire book.  As soon as they manage to fina-fucking-ly pull away from Braavos, Maester Aemon goes ahead and kicks the bucket.

A bunch of guys from the Night's watch stab Jon to death with daggers over him importing the wildlings and wanting to go help fight in Stannis' war.

Stannis' army gets buried in a fuckton of snow and collectively freeze their asses off before even getting to Winterfell.

There's a bunch more, but those are all the plot threads I can recall at just this moment. "
Kinky
"The woodswitch (Maggy the Frog) is with the Old Gods.  Quaithe is from Asshai like Melisandre, and as both are shadowbinders, Quaithe's magic is probably linked to R'hllor too. Mirri Maz Duur is a priestess of the Lhazareen's Great Shepherd. The Warlocks' eastern magics are more unexplained so far in the story, but they seem related to alchemy. 

It's notable that some backstory in the books states the Warlocks' magic was all but gone until recent events (the comet and dragons' birth) that ""brought magic back into the world.""  There are magic items in the books mentioned as suddenly working again after being dormant for years.   It seems like there may be magics from gods and magics from learning/alchemy, with the latter far less effective or consistent."
"Entertaining read, good analysis.  Thanks."
"But she knew this would happen and agreed to it, no? You're saying that she wouldn't have continued to undress if Ramsay didn't say ""don't make me ask again""? So if Theon wasn't there, it wouldn't have been rape? What if she was intent on going through with it either way? The line seems awfully blurry. "
"That's OK, it was actually the information I clicked into here to find."
"Oh, for fuck's sake.

"As hopeful as I am as anyone, never trust IMDB cast listings as pretty much anyone can edit them. The title of Episode 10 certainly refers to [S5E10](#s ""Cersei receiving the Mother's mercy from the Faith for her Walk of Pennance""), although there are typically multiple meanings for episode titles so I hope you're right. Otherwise, this is clearly a massive troll from D&amp;D."
"I did remember seeing them in her throne room after they had taken Mareen, but don't recall seeing them since then."
Almost as enjoyable as the Lannister/Tyrell diner.
"I think part of it is probably because of the fact that the showrunners absolutely mangled his character in previous seasons. He's better in the books.

And it's made more clearly that he's not under her spell and she's not controlling him. Even if she wants to do small things, he makes her give proof first. He's also funnier in the books.

As for what he's done?

In Robert's Rebellion, he held Storm's End against the entire might of the Tyrell army for a year nearly starving to death. Had he not done that, the very large Tyrell army would have been able to go north and help the Targaryens and could have turned the tide. Immediately after the war as everyone else were celebrating, Robert sent Stannis to instead capture Dragonstone, which he also did.

The Ironborn are known for one thing primarily, their naval prowess. Victarion Greyjoy commanded the Iron Fleet during the Greyjoy Rebellion, and Stannis took the Royal Fleet, caught him in a trap and smashed the Iron Fleet off Fair Isle, after which he captured the largest of the Iron Islands. With the threat of the Iron Fleet gone, Robert and his army were able to safely invade and subsequently subdue the rest of the Iron Islands.

Robert Baratheon never praised Stannis for any of this, in fact, after he captured Dragonstone, Robert actually got mad at Stannis for letting Daenerys and Viserys escape. Yet Stannis always did his duty.

In the current war, he had the smallest army, and his traitor younger brother was about to destroy it in the morning. So he used the one advantage he had, and killed one man. So instead of thousands of Baratheon soldiers dying in the morning, one man died at night, and his soldiers instead joined his army.

Despite losing most of his men at Blackwater, he didn't bow down or negotiate a surrender, but planned his next move.

When Davos told him that the Night's Watch required his help, he listened to sound advice. ""I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.""

He took all 4000 of his remaining knights and left his strategic stronghold near King's Landing and went to save the Wall from a wildlings who had already murdered entire villages. Because of his army's enforced discipline, he was able to vanquish Mance Rayder's army which was *20 times* larger than his.

Even Littlefinger and Tyrion Lannister have called him the finest military commander in Westeros.

And you say he's done nothing?"
"Have to agree with that, but I see it as a good thing. Because it doesn't get lame or boring so if they can make the series a bit longer this way and still be at great quality I don't care."
"House Tyrell is a rose because they are outwardly sweet but hide dangerous thorns if mishandled. Their homeland, the Reach, is also the breadbasket of the Seven Kingdoms, so it would make sense for them to choose a plant for their sigil. Their words are ""growing strong"" because they bide their time and slowly work their way up the ladder without arousing much suspicion because, really, who fears a stupid plant? Kudzu their way to power, as it were."

"&gt; They've assumed their tv audience is too unintelligent to keep up with a large cast.

It's not that they think people are dumb, it's just that keeping track of lots of people visually works differently in our brain than keeping track of written information.  How many times have you heard ""and also starring a hundred bearded guys who all look the same?"" as a critique of the show's earlier seasons?  The simple fact is, that a cast of hundreds of named characters can't be made intelligible in under ten hours of screen time per year.  If you think they can, that's only because you've read the books and *already know the information.*"
Nimble Dick?
I really liked that. It was cool getting the same scene from two different points of view.
"The Old Gods are active with direwolf gifts, wargs and greenseers.  The power of weirwoods should be more clear soon too.

The Great Other must be doing something to raise an army of White Walkers.

And the books show the Many Faced God may be the real deal as well.

I also think the Drowned God is active in the story too, just very specific and subtle.

"
And some people are actually saying that Bryan Cogman's a bad writer.
"&gt; I'm not sure why critiquing necessitates having my own version

Because the only way to support your claim that something is unnecessary is to demonstrate its substitute.

&gt; Why does Reek need to go over the edge? 

He might or he might not.  If he does betray Ramsay for Sansa, he'll be just about the only asset she has in Winterfell.

&gt; He's been submissive for so long, why would seeing his kind-of sibling being raped stir feelings in him? 

One could theorize lots of reasons, but clearly it did.

&gt; Sansa already has reason to get back at Ramsay. He's been a dick to her the whole while.

She *just met* the dude.  And ""being a dick"" doesn't warrant a major revenge scheme, which is what I'm hoping for from Sansa.  If Ramsay doesn't earn whatever she's going to end up doing to him, people are going to claim they don't like her character any more, trust me.

&gt; I haven't read the books, so I don't know what it'll happen

I have read them, and I have no idea what will happen.  This part in particular is a very major deviation."
"There is no evidence of that, and it wouldn't make much physiological sense."
"Yeah. Because of Ned. Ned told her that when the King returned from the hunt, he would tell him the truth about Joffrey's real dad. He told her that because he wanted to give her a chance to take her kids to safety because he didn't want to see Robert spilling the blood of children. He was trying to show mercy.

But Cersei used it to save herself. She got Lancel Lannister (the guy who now has short hair and is religious that we saw in the premiere) to increase the amount of wine, possibly mixed with something, that kept him awake, but dulled his senses, so that when he went to hunt the boar, he got hunted by the boar instead."
"&gt; giant red herring

Yeah, I hope."
Depends on what he decides to do about Shireen.
"The Iron Boat is mine, by right."
Because they are tired. David and Dan have said this in interviews. They are anticipating being done with it and getting to rest on their laurels. 
"The few vs the many retort is ridiculous though, because the Tyrell army would still walk all over any uprising KL could throw at them."
"Alright everyone, titties out for Bronn!"
Not relevant here.  Post it to /r/earthoficeandfire instead.
They just need to do an extra '15 minute' episode where that happens xD
"This isn't something that's happened in the books.  But it can be easily theorized from what we've seen so far in the TV show.

1. Arya is in Braavos
2. When she was chanting her kill list, Meryn Trant's name was on it.
3. Meryn Trant is going to Braavos."

"Some reasons why the drop in ratings might be happening this season:

- The first 4 episodes leaking online

- Mother's day

- Memorial day

- The abysmal marketing

- People getting too used to the show having a huge event every other episode from last year

- The continuing increase in online piracy

- Some people quitting the show after Episode 6

- People not liking Tyrion not being the biggest character of the show

- People failing to see the quality in the Wall storyline because they automatically assume that it sucks

- People failing to find Cersei entertaining"

Blackwater.
Spending all that Lannister money.
I wonder where Robert got the blade.
"Mace will hire a faceless man to kill Trant when he suspects he is to be killed.

No, I don't know, but I doubt he will be killed off. He probably isn't as stupid as he seems."
"Also, Visenya's dragon Vhagar grew to the size of Balerion later on, but she eventually died in a fight."
I'll have peace on those terms!
Not everyone is in for story I guess. Some just want Dragons all over the place and battles here and there.

"That's later. Here's how their first time goes down:

&gt;He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and she looked into his eyes. “No?” he said, and she knew it was a question. She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. “Yes,” she whispered as she put his finger inside her.

Dany is afraid, but decidedly in control, or at least significantly more so than she appeared in that scene on the show. However, yes, it does sound like straight up rape later on. My guess is that the showrunners wanted to capture that later feeling in the first time, but that's not how that moment went down in the books. I was just trying to ward off potential criticism of comparisons between Sansa's and Dany's respective rape scenes due to Dany's wedding night situation being significantly different in the books, because really here all that matters is how the two scenes were portrayed on the the show, and that would be quite similarly."
"I've seen people say that it's feminist rape, not actual rape. Why? Because she agreed to marry him, it's the bedding ceremony, she starts to undress when asked, and never says no. Just because people don't like the idea of having sex with someone, doesn't mean they don't consent to the sex.

We as the viewer need to remember its a show that takes place in another time.

To each their own though. "
Like head cheese
I literally LOLed for a good 30 seconds.   He couldn't have said it any better.
"Don't think Dany really cares, lol. "
"Maybe.  I mean, Essos does extend off the right edge of any known map.

Or it might be that she needed to get her dragon trained and another khalasar following her in order to finish up the Meereen quest so she can get a move on."
"Yeah, that doesn't make sense. Nymeria would be in captivity, and probably not much less of a little bitch than Reek."
Doesn't appear to work.

"Mace the Ace Tyrell. He would be genuinely shocked, considering all the honors he (believed he) received during his lifetime."
I like you.
"No, offc they're not going to let Myrcella go back with Jaime."
"Alright then. I'm still confused, but it's what you think."
"I think they are setting up for Shireen to be burnt. Maybe Stannis finds out and attacks Melisandre and she kills him. Or worst comes to worst, he lets her do the burning. He'd never do it though, and if he did, it would be so off character."
"Yeah, I don't know why people assume that in a massive city that formerly ran on an economy involving people at all walks of life, which has been completely upended, they couldn't find plenty of skilled fighters for their resistance movement.  Like the *only* people who would have a beef with Dany are fat lazy rich people."
"""Your father betrayed my father"" well it would be really quick all Tyrion needs to talk about is killing Tywin over a toilet."
True.  They fought like shit and it was a shame Barristan had to die for them.
You should watch it again and note how the now-old man took out over a dozen of them while multiple were attacking him at once.  He did fine.  It was the Unsullied using war spears in cramped town walkways that fought poorly.  It looked like Grey Worm was the only one of them with real training.
GET HYPE
"The books.

Roose Bolton had about 10 000 men of the Northern army under his control after the Green Fork. After he started to secretly work with Tywin he started sending the Stark loyalists in his army on suicide missions. Once he came to the Twins he had with him about 3 500 Boltons and 500 Karstarks."
"That's my thought too. The thing happens, she does the thing, and then seemingly nothing happens. She looks devastated, then they cut to a different location, where the thing that was intended to happen to one person in the previous scene happens to this person in this scene and the season ends with eyes suddenly opening.

Is that vague enough to avoid spoiler or speculation tags?"

Ned is largely responsible for the fact that he's at the Wall. Thorne was a Targaryen loyalist during the war and was defending King's Landing when it was sacked by Tywin. He was given the choice between death and the Wall.

"You posted with [Theory].  Obvious foreshadowing in the show with S5 points to Sam and Gilly both not being safe in Castle Black anymore, and that's MY THEORY covered by your title tag warning.

"Yeah, those torture scenes were certainly off-putting, but I don't think we as the viewing audience would have truly believed Theon's transformation into Reek without them. As difficult as they were to watch, we needed to see those scenes in order to understand just what could have turned him into the empty shell of a former man that he has become."
"Sansa is still married to Tyrion in the books. He does have her undress and he really really wants her, but he ultimately resists doing anything to her."
"Oh, right, that one's a typo too, duh. I just assumed it was yet another fashion term I didn't know..."

"I thought somehow the Boltons had captured Nymeria, and now Sansa, having lost Lady, would not become best friends with Nymeria :(

Also that if in the future someone sent Arya the Faceless Man to asassinate Sansa, Nymeria being by her side would bring No One back to being Arya."

So much this. 
"Many of these characters are just as unimportant to the plot.  He's still a fan favorite.

And unlike them, we've already gone past the point where could possibly be introduced.  Most of the rest of these might still turn up."
"Yeah... well, definitely with the darker shade of purple. The picture you provided is far too distracting."
"&gt; what was the point of TV Cersei making the High Sparrow High Septon? ...she re-establishes the Faith Militant, and why?

She thinks the High Sparrow can be controlled/bought, or at the very least that he might feel loyalty to her for the support she gives.  She wants him in the position so that he can be a weapon she can use against others.  Most everyone is corrupt in some way or another, and with a righteous order bent on cleaning up the town, Cersei can point them at her targets.  And then when they do her dirty work, she's absolved of blame because she doesn't directly control the church.

&gt;  Because she wanted an excuse to imprison Ser Loras for being gay, on account of she doesn't like the Tyrells... Couldn't she have found an easier way to do that?

That's more about the show simplifying the book's plot.  In the book remember Loras is sent off to take Dragonstone, and he's reportedly injured/maimed as a result.  His story arc there is now combined with the Faith Militant, and I assume they will severely injure him in some similar fashion so that the end result is the same.

&gt;  On this week's episode she sends King Tommen, her last living son, to confront the high Septon armed with nothing more than a few Kingsguard against a LITERAL army of people who could easily murder him with no repercussions whatsoever.

She doesn't see the danger, just as she has no idea they can come for her too. She's blinded by her belief that she can ""play the game"" as well as Tywin, and she can't.

"I found that scene strange, too. I think the director focused on it for a few seconds too long."
I see more people write his name like that. Just wtf? How hard can it be xD
To the show it is.
The Vale.
HYPE IS COMING!
"If he can make me say ""Well,  Joffrey wasn't *all bad*, was he?"" deserves special recognition. "
"""This subplot smells like shit! Keep moving!"""
"I know why she wants to kill her in the books, but why would she kill her in the show when Sansa is so close and Brienne is clearly trying to protect her?"
"You're contradicting yourself now. In the post, you made it sound like only Dany could control them. That is not true at all. Now you're admitting that she can't. You know, her Meereen storyline is not completely about her dragons. In fact, it's not at all. GRRM has explicitly stated that he wanted the audience to see the tiring and day-to-day parts of ruling, not just the wars and festivals. 

And people have killed dragons before. It's definitely possible. "
"[Direwolf foreshadowing for Rickon with Shaggydog](#g ""The books have Rickon taken Skagos by Osha.  The inhabitants are reportedly savages, but more likely they're simply very tough Northerners who can protect Rickon.  Shaggydog's wild-dog actions suggest Rickon will fit in fine there.  The show's simplified plot takes Rickon to stay with the Umbers, where watchers will remember the Greatjon as one of the Stark's strongest supporters.  They're also guaranteed to keep him safe.  What that should be for is simply saving Rickon till the very end of the story when he's in a position to reappear and take over leadership of the North as the remaining Stark heir.  The name shaggydog is a joke reference to that fate.  A 'shaggy dog story' is a very long-winded tale filled with a lot of non-relevant events that finally  ends with a disconnected or anticlimactic ending.  Rickon is the punchline to the shaggy dog tale, because he's probably going to be forgotten and left out of the story till the very end.  He's just there to take over Winterfell when no one else is left."")

And that's because:

[Direwolf foreshadowing for Sansa with Lady](#g ""Sansa won't be able to rule Winterfell because she'll be ruling Westeros as Queen on the Iron Throne.  As all of the other Starks are best at what they do, Sansa's direwolf Lady insures she won't be a generic noble Lady, she'll be THE Lady, i.e. Queen on the Iron Throne."")"
"As long as they can be king of the ashes.

Er, snow, I mean."
"I think it's okay. Not terribly exciting, but I'll wait until the season is actually over before saying anything."
"[Direwolf foreshadowing for Sansa and Lady](#g ""Not so.  Her direwolf would never have worked in Court.  It would have alienated her, and certainly after the coup against Ned the Lannisters would have killed Lady anyway.  You can think the direwolf names are intended as a prophecy from the Old Gods (I like to think that), but it's still always just GRRM dropping hints.  The death of Lady was more foreshadowing that Sansa would lose her connection to her family and her Northern heritage.  She has had to make her own way in urban environments with politics and plots.  Even Arya separated from Nymeria is connected in her dreams, which is also likely how Arya will never forget her past.  Lady's death was the loss of that connection, not the loss of her fate as Queen."")"
lol!
The reversal of facial expressions is pretty interesting.

She didn't fly so good.
"Just take Jorah back, DANY!"
"Well he is alive, but no Theon anymore ;S "
I came.
He is the rightful heir. And he has been really growing on me this season. 
"Depends on who you ask. According to the Crown Tommen I Baratheon is the lord of Storm's End as well as the King. But according to Stannis he is the rightful lord of Storm's End, and he does still technically possess it at this point. His man, Gilbert Farring, is still holding the castle (though Stannis certainly has no control over all the lords of the region)."
Precisely.
Any pregnant women might want to slowly start moving towards nearest exit.
"Not only that, she was born at Dragonstone island during a huge storm at the same time Robert was killing her dad at the Trident.  She also hatched the dragons from their stone-like eggs (waking dragons from stone).  I think she's so obvious that the other character matches are desperate red herrings to throw us off the trail."
I'm pretty sure they've got lots of eyes on the Tarlys as it is.

Pretty much every AA theory is a desperate attempt to explain why it shouldn't obviously be Dany.
Death &amp; Defenestration.
"The actors grow more expensive every year, and the kid actors literally grow. The core crew probably also wants to move on in their lifes, and can you blame them? They've been making the show since 2007 or something."
"Hmm. Perhaps the High Sparrow would believe him, and declare him king because all the other canditates are either infidels or abominations. Not sure if Gendry would want to be supported by radical fanatics though."
The circumstances are very very different in the books.
"Pretty much. Just another reason why I enjoy the show. The ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" are still human."
"IIRC he actually dismissed that in another interview.

Also, work is work, and GoT would definitely make him more famous again."
"He isn't a writer for the show, so no. The writers are free to use whatever they want from his books, of course. And Tyrion's line about sucking a dwarf's cock was in his internal monologue in A Dance with Dragons. He never said it out loud."
"Ah, theories..."
"Darnell, classic King's Landing name."
What...? This is not Dorne.
Areo was actually pretty cool. The move he showed Jaime was easily the best choreographed move in the episode.
"I think it's just a line the writer used to get Jaime and Bronn caught, might not be much else to it."
"I agree, he was definitely the nicest leader of a band of murderers and rapists."
"The showrunners keep saying that they aim to finish the show in 7 seasons, but they've also mentioned 8 as a possibility. HBO wants it to go on for 10 or more seasons, but also say that they will ultimately let the writers decide.

I'd be down for 8 seasons or at least an extended 7th season to wrap the show up."
"I think he will make a big show of wanting revenge for his daughter, and the audience is going to love him for it, and in the end she just points at him and he drops dead and she carries on like nothing happened."
What a shame. No role worthy my greatness. Maybe season 7 then.

"Double standards.

But also people are desensitized to violence."
"While that would be ideal, I think this is going to be a tragedy instead. They've established that his troops are suffering. If it was the last resort at the end of the season and he said no, that would be one thing, but he said no too early, which means she's gonna ask again when times are more dire."
"Different sure, but if people die on the show, It's safe to assume they will die at some points in the books."
"Agreed. I actually like Dany's character, but the Essosi characters that she meets (aside from Khal Drogo and the Spice King) are just so boring."
And neither of them were ever trying to put Dany on the throne.
Aaand then the Hound interrupted it.
Why did you use same picture for little Sam for season 1 and 5. Little Sam wasn't even born in season 1/2.
"I imagine they're really handy for people who have a hard time remembering relevant past details getting a quick refresher.

"Alright, thanks."

It's forced bestiality. How is that not revolting.
"I think Trant will want to have Mace be seen there.  It'll take a little bit to get him away from witnesses and come up with a good excuse to make it look like a Braavosi sellsword got to him.

Then Mace will turn around and go ""Meryn?  Where'd ya go?"""

"It feels like I'm being violated, but I also like it a bit."

"Even in the books I wasn't thrilled with Robb.  I didn't dislike him or anything, I just thought ""the son inherits the lords from the father, forms an army and attacks their enemies"" made him kind of a stock/standard character.  If he had succeeded it would have been a really boring way for the good guys to win.  When people freaked out over him dying I was like ""meh.""  Catelyn was a much bigger loss for me, as she was a much more interesting character.

You know who pisses me off is Rickard Karstark.  He puts a sword in his son's hand, sends him into battle, his son dies, so then he spends the rest of the time bawling like a little bitch over his son falling in honorable combat.  Acting like he was murdered at home or something.  Robb should have shamed the fuck out him early on for being such a whiny pussy.  As well for dishonoring his son's service to the war effort."

Good question. I am really hoping that a sizable piece of Theon came back from what he had to witness last night. I believe this is the beginning of his redemption arc.
I'd have liked her to do an internship with Stannis.

"Why couldn't it be both? While he might be full of shit and lie, liars would be even more particular about what they say, so if they didn't have Kings/Queens before, he would obviously not have said it, which makes it likely it was just something the writers overlooked, and they meant it as rulers and not as Queen."
"I would hope he wouldn't mistake Robert for Gregor Clegane.   

Robert was a hothead; Cersei and Jaime would be a puddle of pink meat when he wiped off his warhammer.  But I don't see him butchering children, especially those whom he raised as his own. Tommen and Myrcella were fine children, it was Joffrey who was the worst.  At most he would disown them and exile them. "
"How is that an error? A crowned stag has been the sigil of House Baratheon since Aegon's conquest, and before that it was the sigil of House Durrandon since the Dawn Age, according to legend."
"She wasn't actually part of that group, but she does follow the same God as Thoros of Myr, who is.  However, there really isn't any consistency among red priest abilities.  Thoros can't make shadow babies, for example.  In fact, other than possibly reading visions from flames, I don't think there's one ability in the entire chronicle that any two red priests share.

If resurrection was that common, you'd think we would have heard more about it, because it would solve most peoples' problems most of the time.  First of all, people would have heard about it; there'd be rumors everywhere about what the red priests can do.  Second of all, Cersei would have definitely called for every red priest they can find to come bring back Joffrey (now there's a disturbing thought: zombie Joffrey).

Rather, I think Thoros calling the resurrection energy into Beric was a one-time inexplicable ""miracle.""  Now that it's here, whoever is carrying it can be resurrected repeatedly (Beric, then LSH) but if it were just a ""spell"" that any red priest can cast whenever they want, you'd think there would be tons of resurrectable people running around by now."

"About 5% of the material in Season 5 so far has been from the books. Season 1 was very close to the books (I'd give it an 85% similarity, maybe. The difference were usually just because of having a low budget). Season 2 took more liberties. Season 3 and 4 both really went off the rails and now in Season 5 the books are completely irrelevant to the show."

"The fact that she's now some sort of undead skinless spirit looking for revenge is a gigantic trope. She's evil now? That's not character development, that's just a sudden, terribly steep change in personality. Yes, I'd really like to see Cat alive again, but does she really make a difference except kill random Freys and the occasional Podrick or Brienne? She serves no greater purpose, and is a stereotypical zombie overlord. Stoneheart has no redeeming qualities other than being Catelyn Stark when still alive. Overall, boring character. We can just keep hesitantly cheering until she kills enough people so that everyone hates her and she still has no effect on the main story.

"People keep claiming Melisandre is evil, but she's not.  She sees the big picture clearly.  There's a zombie apocalypse coming, and when it sweeps down none of the petty politics over who rules what is going to matter.  In the face of the extinction of all humanity, burning a few people is worth it.

But this scene, when she was actually putting the case to Stannis for burning Shireen, seriously gave me some Azor Ahai vibes."
"I think you're putting way too much discount on political marriages.  You *want* to marry your kids into power positions.  That's *good* for them.  It hasn't always worked out that way here, but the matches you're complaining about were excellent scores.  And giving Stannis a bonus because he's failed to betrothe Shireen to anybody  doesn't help either.  A betrothal would give her an additional political alliance and further protection after he's gone.  He isn't doing her any favors like this.

&gt;  Theon and Jon were his wards, and by extension, his children.

If Stannis had wards, he wouldn't see it that way.  And Ned treated Jon pretty well.  Far more than most highborn lords treat their bastards.  And if serving the Night's Watch was good enough for his uncle Benjen, it was good enough for him."

Basically, she is a young girl infatuated with a confident and attractive man who also heaps compliments on her. It should also be said that Daario is a huge scumbag in the books. He really is a bloodthirsty cutthroat, much more so than his show counterpart. She knows that he is no good for her, but he is her escape to fantasy, pretty much.

But the real point is that whether or not someone is posting fake/real theories/spoilers about anything *YOUR* comments must follow the same warning scope defined by the post title.  If someone posts a blatant spoiler comment, and you reply with the same spoilers, you are breaking the rules just as badly.  Mind your own posts and tag accordingly."
Obviously. That's the Horn of Joramun. 
That is outside [the scope of this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/posting_policy).    No references to modern real-world religion.  No drama.
"I think you are being far too critical. It's a show. 

But just to humor you, I don't think they expected much from this ""old man"", plus they outnumbered him. He had that advantage on top of being a champion fighter. I do agree that the Unsullied shouldn't have been defeated so easily. I mean spear vs knife is a no-brainer. Reach is everything. I didn't really care for where the fight took place either, but besides that, pretty enjoyable scene. 

Did Barristan die? 

Dany has already made dumb decisions left and right. 
"
She seems so familiar for some reason even though I'm sure it was an extra.
"It isn't that much? A few(er) more episode wouldn't hurt, but I haven't catched up with the books and I can easily follow everything that is going on."
"*Reek, Reek, it rhymes with freak. I know, I know, oh oh oh.*"
Catelyn Stark plays Nathan's mum.

Yup.
Even though he's made it clear that he cares not for money or possessions.
"God no. Episodes 4, 5 and 6 were better than episodes 1, 2 and 3. Kissed by Fire and What is Dead May Never Die were both the second best episodes of their respective seasons. ""Sons of the Harpy"" wasn't a bad episode, and it still has what is so far the best scene of this season. As for ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unroken"". I think people are letting the Sand Snake fight (of which I would mainly blame the director) and the last scene (which I thought was very well written) cloud their judgement.

Are people forgetting the stuff that D&amp;D have pulled over the years like Talisa?"
That is not remotely no spoilers content.  [No Spoilers] means no spoilers.  You need to [read the spoiler guide.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide)

For powah!
You must have been crushed after tonight's episode. 
"Gosh I am not the only one. Ramsay was just a fucked up guy in the last seasons, but now the story and his scenes are pretty interesting."
Ramsay with blood on his face. Please give me a Stannis vs Ramsay duel.
Did they use the King's Landing High Sparrow set for Meereen too?
Over the High Sparrow and the Tyrells? Hell yeah.
"Birth it there, yeah."
Really [unfortunate advertising](http://imgur.com/QCpTWsl) over*lay*ed on that first image...
I hope he gets to outlaw beets.
Watching your mind in action is truly a wonder to behold.
"Yeah despite everything Viserys did, I pitied him when he went out. It was quite sad really. The actor really nailed the scene.

He was a boy with a baby sister he dragged with him and clothed and fed, while begging for support. At one point he even had to sell his mother's crown. The Targ madness took hold though and he went a bit bad, but compared to crazy Targs he wasn't even that bad."
"The story of how Roose ended up with Fat Walda always makes me chuckle.

Walder Frey offered Roose the bride's weight in silver as dowry if he married one of his daughters/granddaughters, so Roose Bolton, ever the pragmatist, chose the fattest one."
Psh no he doesn't.
"That's the *overt* meaning.  It's literally what he was talking about.

OP is clearly suggesting that there's a meaning other than what Aemon was intending..."
"Michelle Fairley, Red Wedding, best acted scene ever."
My problem with Brienne is that her plot clearly wasn't going anywhere.  Just back to yet another chapter of her going door to door asking if anyone has seen a maiden of three and ten with chestnut hair.  No?  I'll try the next door...  It's a plot thread that wandered off into a dead end and kept going.
"A death was what he had earned, not... this."
Red heads have a lot to say on Jon Snow's intelligence.
We know Cersei's walk is happening this season. There have also been pictures of Tyrion and Daenerys sitting together in Daznak's Pit. Rumor has it that Varys is going to kill Littlefinger as well.
"Which five queens? I can recall Cersei, Margaery, Dany, Sansa, and Myrce-

oh...
Okay. Nevermind then. I'll leave this here if anyone else is confused, though."
"Gods, I hope so."
That would even be fucked up for Game of Thrones.
"The books, like the show, only rarely show anything fantastical.  However they have a lot more historical and mythological information which unlike our own fairy tales, one can reasonably assume to be true, because magic is real.  That said, due to the lack of magic for so long, most of the characters don't really believe in that stuff."
"My theory is that Nymeria will be the reason Arya retains her identity after her training.

I'm sure the FM have dealt with trainees who hid a personal belonging somewhere before now.  They've probably got a long history of dealing with that, and clearly they're good at what they do.  But it's quite possible - likely even - that one thing their training program can't handle is warging.  It's very rare in the modern age, and only seems to occur in the far north end of Westeros, which is extremely foreign to Braavos.

[AFFC](#b ""Arya is regularly having dreams of being a direwolf in the Riverlands leading a huge pack of wolves.  That is, she's still connected to Nymeria.  That's a magical link to her identity that would be immune to training programs."")"
He's a nice guy and they could have a perfect Tyrell style marriage with her pulling all the strings and him remaining clueless and happy.  Just like her dad.  If Cersei wasn't fucking everything up.
"No, I don't think so. Though he has every reason to be upset with him. 

Jaimie knows how Tyrion has been treated by Tywin. "
"If those are mad decisions, then I guess 95% of the characters in GoT are mad."
You and me both.
"""WHY IS MY BROTHER IN A CELL?!?""

(Tommen's thought process) *""Jeez, I'm just having breakfast here.  OK, she seems really angry so this must not be a fun riddle game.  Who was her brother again?  Oh yeah, Lancel, that was it, with the curly hair.  What kind of cell would he be in?  I have some cells.  I didn't put anybody in any cells though... Shit, she's still looking at me with that insanely angry face that mom is always making.  This is worse than the time she asked me if that dress made her look fat.""*"
This might actually have been an improvement.
As long as they can be king of the ashes.
He was perfect those nine episodes.   Wonderfully set up the civil war(s) that followed.  His shadow looms large over Westeros.
I honestly don't think he cared.
Nah.  He'd want to talk first.  And in talking the desire would go out of him.  I think he was just talking shit because he was pissed off.
"I can imagine him waking up and going, ""What the fuck, I was just napping. You were about to bury me? You dicks!"""
She's basically his little sister.
I don't think it's very flattering to have Ramsay be a subscriber to /r/fatpeoplehate.  He's kind of what they remind me of anyways.
Why it's not doing the books justice or why it doesn't need to do the books justice?

"Because Jorah was actually supposed to fight, Tyrion wasn't. And they couldn't let Tyrion escape.

I'd be down for a disfigured Loras. The only question is: how would he be disfigured?
"&gt; I figured that the big bold paragraph would be the first thing anyone sees when they come to the post. 

That still breaks the sub's rules on spoiler warnings, and people still got spoiled by seeing the wrong warning.  The rules we have i place here are designed to provide as much safety as is realistically possible in an online setting like this.  And they have been pretty well tested now over the last four years, so we have a good idea what works consistently.  

&gt; Aren't mods able to change titles, though?

Reddit does not allow titles, thumbs, or links to be changed once a post is submitted.  The only way to alter any of them is to make a new post.  Mods' powers are similarly limited to the subreddits they moderate.  We can't change a user's post, only what appears in the subreddit.  A post removed from a sub is still in the user's history; it's just hidden from the rest of the public browsing the sub.  So even if titles could be edited, that'd be a user ability and not for mods to do either.  We don't moderate accounts at all, just the scope of subreddits."

"That's under ""Other notes and clarifications"" to provide extra, specific examples for people who don't understand the actual rule list at the top with:

* Something related to the show or books should exist in the image/article/etc. prior to the post, and that connection should be the focus/point.
* Posts about non-related subjects that have only a casual connection are not relevant to story discussion

Your post was primarily about the actors doing other jobs.  Yes, the writer tried very hard to make as many GOT references as possible, but the other jobs are not really about GOT.  Most of those have also already attempted to be posted here, especially the Kristofer Hivju vids.  The clarifications section also links to the [What Not To Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/dont_post) list of even more specific examples of things that people have tried to post when they don't read the rules, and that list includes:

* Joffrey was in Batman, or any other actor's past roles
* Charles Dance Dancing, or any other actor's past roles
* Robert's Early Days when Mark Addy was in A Knight's Tale, or any other actor's past roles
* Robert's Early Days when Mark Addy was in Flintstones, or any other actor's past roles

The list is out of date now as there are at least another half dozen newer commercials, films, and songs that are getting regularly reposted in recent months. But none of that is about the show or books; it's about the actors.  The ""almost never relevant"" is because on very rare occasions someone posts something that ties back to some other role or job but also very directly relates to the show.  The casting comparison photos are like that.

"This one for sure, thank you!"
Never blame the writing or directing. Always blame the actor. /s
But you can read the same book at the 'same time'. Use two bookmarks and when you are working your wife can read etc?

Well since you've confirmed you have been reading and discussing theories with readers that means all this martyrdom of yours is a big waste of time.

They already send Jorah a royal pardon back in Season 1. I assume that the letter they send to Barristan (which was given to him by one of Varys' little birds) was a copy of that pardon.

"I've been working with spoiler tagging on Reddit for longer than Alien Blue has existed.  Reddit has never provided CSS support, and all spoiler tagging on Reddit has been about using CSS to fake the tagging effect native to most forum systems. Originally, when subreddit first tried to bring spoiler tags to Reddit, the markup link was altered with CSS in a variety of inconsistent ways.  Different methods worked with varied levels of success on different browsers, and it was mostly a mess.  I was tired of that when I reworked the tagging here back in 2011.  For the first version I pulled examples of tags from every subreddit using them I could find and took the best bits of each as a baseline, and from there tweaked the code till it worked for all browsers.  That style slowly became the most common on Reddit, and when we changed from the / to # to better support mobile users that change also spread.  The way tags are done here *is* the Reddit standard.  I've seen my code copy-pasted in dozens of other subs.  

The original link switch for tags was commonly /s or /spoiler.  /s was shorter and easier, which is why it was used here.  Most subs only needed one tag, but there has always been a need for multiple.  From the very beginning this sub had /s and /b for show and book spoilers.  I know /r/thewalkingdead and /r/lost were both prominent back then with multiple tags too.  Not all subs used /s even then, but all tags started with a ""/"" for the link, and most put the spoiler in the title attribute.  

So when Alien Blue comes along and only supports ""/s,"" they got it wrong from the beginning.  I personally tried to document the variants and explain the need to support what already exists on Reddit in multiple subs.  It was a while after the change to # for touch screens that Alien Blue added ""#s"" support.  **All Alien Blue has to do is tag by ""/"" and ""#"" not ""/s"" and ""#s"" to add support.**  It's that simple, and they won't do it.  

&gt; You would have to go through each sub's custom commands and write the code into the app to work like other spoilers, which is too hard or time consuming for all of them it seems.

That's their argument, which is a weak lie.  I've worked as an application programmer for well over a decade, and most of the time it was working with other programmers' old code that needed updating.  The only way it's ""too hard"" is if their code is a complete mess.  

&gt; There are 2 spoiler commands that work site wide, that a couple of the apps use, that appear as the black bar spoilers like in this post. The green/red bars that this sub uses are specific to this sub only, are therefore don't work on any app that I have tried so far.

Multiple spoiler tag use is common on Reddit.  Just for a very easy example, go to the list of subs on /r/television and visit them all.  Notice how many use multiple tags, and how some don't even use ""s"" for any of them.  I don't see why you're saying that when it's blatantly not true.

What apps have you tried then?  Baconreader, Reddit is Fun, and Reddit Sync are by far the most recommended every time I see someone ask for suggestions.  They all work fine.   Reddit Sync makes all spoiler tags variants blue.  Baconreader and Reddit is Fun both make them all black.  Just to be 100% sure they still have support, I checked current versions of all three just now with the Mod message stickied to the top of this sub.  It has both show and theory spoilers tagged in the OP text, and the different spoiler tags worked in all three of those apps.

Jorah vs Stannis would be a good fight. I think Jorah would take it though.

"Oh, yes it does. That's ridiculous. All the lords of the North are being invited to the wedding, as it's purpose is to secure their allegiance. If news from Meereen is making its way to Castle Black (which really doesn't make any sense) then news from the North should be making its way to King's Landing and the queen regent, for crying out loud."

"In this sub we moderate events.  Someone who is alive at the beginning of the active story is assumed to still be alive till the character is not.  That change is the spoiler.  Mentioning a character with a book or season is also needed for good spoiler title tagging anyway; it's proven to prevent more serious spoiling.  In the context of a thread like this that's only marked [TV], mentioning anything in the books that has not yet been depicted on the show is a spoiler and needs a tag."

Even HBO's depiction of the story is filled with graphic deaths, rape and torture.  They're part of the story.  If seeing a scene with a nearly completely off-camera rape is too much for you, I recommend you find a different show to watch."

"Yes, the undead are called wights, but I believe the ""ice demons"" are properly called Others. It's always been unclear to me whether White Walkers was a synonym for those, or just a general catch-all term for both as a group. The show certainly seems to give the latter impression."
At that age it'd make more sense for him to rebel against Cersei and support Margery.

"If you want to try to account for that dip that based on the leaks, you could gather piracy statistics, and try to come up with a comparative analysis.  Some data on the record-breaking download counts for the leaked episodes is in [this article](http://torrentfreak.com/game-of-thrones-piracy-surges-to-new-high-150422/), and here are some regular download numbers from [2014](http://torrentfreak.com/game-thrones-season-finale-sets-piracy-record-140616/) and [2013](http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-pirated-tv-shows-of-the-season-130622/).  There have been a lot of articles like that mentioning numbers. You could create a chart like your link showing the trend of downloads to extrapolate how many expected piracy downloads there should have been for Season 5.  Subtract that from the leak numbers, and then you can compare the difference to the drop in viewership to whatever increase was caused by the leaks to see if there's any similarity in numbers.  Might not end up being relevant, but it would probably still be interesting."
So goes the theory.
Yes. Asha is currently still holding Deepwood Motte. 
Nope. They only know to fly one way. 
That's the problem. He does a ton in the books.
Now *That* would be noticeable. 
My two biggest complaints are that ultimately the fate of Slaver's Bay is irrelevant and that there are pretty much no interesting Essosi characters.
"Usually when I try to keep something in my mind I forget it, and when I try to forget something it stays in my mind."
Nobody knows because none of this is in the books. The Faith isn't supposed to really care if people are gay. 
"Meh, that one didn't bother me all that much. I mean, yeah, it was a bit silly and over-the-top, but it didn't make me cringe at how bad it was quite the way Yara's absurd little adventure did.

"There's no way Jorah should already be able to tell he has contracted the disease. That was just a bit of foolishness in the show in order to rush the revelation. It was also odd that Jorah was so concerned about the stone men touching them. The disease is generally spread through water/urine/feces. So it made no sense for Tyrion to dive into the water. Apparently things are different in the show, however. *shrug*"

Yes, Winter has arrived in the books.

""Arya choice to join Jaqen has some consequences or is it just a ""cool side story ?""

Arya never meets the guy who was masquerading as Jaqen again after escaping from Harrenhal. That's only in the show.

""Is there a link between all the people who believe in that ""Lord of light"" that cast more shadows than light?""

They're linked in that they belong to the same religion.

""Gendry does he matters, or was it just like a disposable character which I should skip scene with the next time I'll look previous seasons ? I thought his royal blood made him more special than just give us sex scene with that hot redhead sorceress.""

How about where you left off?
There's this guy called Ramsay in Winterfell. I'm not sure he'd be happy to learn that his pet was spreading tales.
Two continuous Targaryen rulers with very intelligent Lannister Hands.
Honestly I liked him more for it.
"I love it! And hopefully Tyrion can do a good word for Jorah, because I love that guy even more!"
"Considering that everybody who knew about his parentage in King's Landing is dead or elsewhere, he could probably go right back to the blacksmith shop where he was working and get his old job back.  Ned didn't tell the blacksmith why he took him or what he wanted with him, so Gendry could just say he got laid off due to employer decapitation.

Not that they *will* write him back into the show, but if he's chilling in King's Landing, they could easily bring him back into the action any time they want.  With D&amp;D going completely off the rails relative to the books, they might actually choose to exercise that option.  Their main goal right now seems to be recycling old characters over introducing new ones, to keep fan favorite actors on screen as much as possible."
Because it is Jamie Lannister I guess?
Hence proved.
"Does anyone know how Littlefinger came across that Valyrian steel dagger? 

Does it have a name?

Why he would bet such an item is beyond me. "
"I think she wanted a shadow demon baby to take to Castle Black.  The're trying to give the already-established characters more screen time, so one more ""Jon resists temptation"" scene kinda makes sense, after Stannis and Davos tried already.

We have yet to see her use any kind of healing magic whatsoever.  None of the Red Priests seem to have the same spell selection, beyond perhaps flame divination.  There's no evidence that she can heal or resurrect anybody at all."
Power. Simple as that.
"Yeah, guerrilla warfare."
Unsullied = people who only watch the show.
"I don't think that was the reason.  I think they wanted him to visit Oldtown before he died, and probably introduce Sam there for training."

"Not to mention, Tansy, which moon tea is also referred to as, was actually mentioned in the previous episode in another context."

"Yeah, it's not like they need good reviews at this point. The show's got plenty of momentum.  And four episodes was way more than necessary anyways.  Most shows just do 1 or 2, if that."
"Seriously, if an aqueduct is that big... and there were huge mountains in the background, coated with buildings. Hnnggggghhh"
"Why would the blacksmith do that?  All he knows is that he sold Gendry to the Hand of the King a few years back.  That Hand later got decapitated for treason, so presumably Gendry is unemployed now and could go back to his job.  That was a few years ago.  Some guards *were* looking for him (or at least ""some guy with a bull helmet"") a while back on orders of King Joffrey, but Joffrey is dead now too.

Nobody left in King's Landing knows who Gendry is, *except* for that blacksmith.  And not even he knows why anybody cared about Gendry to begin with."
Lazy screenwriter #2.
"&gt; though it's predominantly a show subreddit.

We don't treat one any differently than the other.  There are physically more viewers than readers, and the show's airing right now.

Exactly.
"That would be spectacular. Honestly I really thought something like this would be the perfect closing visual for the season finale, so now I'm worried about what we might be closing the season with instead..."

"It's not an ""absolutely everything"" thing.  Assume that what was supposed to happen offscreen happens *unless* a scene shows you how the plan went awry.  We don't need to see someone taking a shit to assume that people (other than Tywin) ever shit.  We don't need to see someone get out of a boat after they got in a boat or else we should assume they're rowing forever.  If something was deviating from plan, that would call for a scene onscreen.  If we *don't* see that scene, then we can assume it went like it was supposed to.  Gendry ""still rowing"" or ending up somewhere else would be a major deviation, and should therefore be an incredibly important plot point, if it wasn't shown to us.  I don't see how it could be a major plot point."
"Most of the inhabitants of the Red Keep are not Lannisters... Cersei is there becaus she's the queen, Jaime is a Kingsguard knight, and Lancel and Tyrek are Robert's squires."

"Lady Olenna does run shit, but Garlan is a force to be reckoned with too. Hopefully we get to see him next season."
"Yup. I was really afraid we were going to have to see *that* last night. As horrific as the scene was, I was almost relieved. Grateful the on-screen moment was at least over quickly."
"&gt;and Yara's rescue attempt

It was the books I think that she refers to Tywin and Ned as the Usurper's dogs. I was so mad in that moment because this was the first time someone spoke negatively about Ned.

[Books theory about Jaime and Cersei](#g ""Cersei's prophecy really points more toward Jaime as her killer, after all of her children are dead.  It makes very good sense with the character arcs."") I think that's a given in the books, and as an important plot point I expect the show will include that too."
"The last time the Mountain went up against Ser Loras, someone intervened on Loras' behalf. Hype?"
:( Is that source completely canon?
"Basically too many focus points and not enough time to go around. Under the circumstances, I think they're doing pretty good. "
"It certainly makes her more relatable, but it still doesn't bring the child back. If the deed is gruesome does the motive still matter?"
Theon and Sam are odd picks.
"I loved it, but I love everything with Jorah and Tyrion xD"
Oh my gods.
I'd legit change my name to Westeros if it meant getting a decent role on the show.
Jon tried to find Bran.  He figured the only place Bran could have gotten to where could have survived was Craster's.  Jon went to Craster's and didn't find Bran there.  So he assumes Bran is dead.
"I think they are trying to set it up so that the one King still in Westeros who could bring order, Stannis, will die just when people realize that the realm needs him, at least for now."
"Not necessary? I myself was beginning to forget how terrible Ramsay is. How are they supposed to get married without consummating later. It's not something to gloss over, especially since this is Ramsay we're talking about. What else is supposed to happen? Seriously, think of something else that might've gone down successfully in Winterfell during the wedding, which at the same time gives Theon and Sansa's characters proper payoff. You know, if it was actually Jeyne Poole in this scene, I doubt anyone would've cared as much and would be focusing on how shitty the Sand Snakes are. There are plenty more reasons than ""shock value"" (production costs, casting, REASONABLE STORY PROGRESSION, making us remember why we hate Boltons, etc.) and it wasn't as bad as the source material. Jaime&gt;Cersei scene was universally frowned upon since it never existed in the books. Just because none of us wanted to see this happen doesn't mean it automatically stops making sense. "
"Charles Dance&gt;Sean Bean&gt;Alfie Allen&gt;Peter Dinklage

So far the best of Season 5:

Stephen Dillane&gt;Lena Heady&gt;Kit Harrington&gt;Peter Dinklage"
"She's finally out of her Darth Sansa attire, thank god!"
"Tommen is 9-10 years old at that point in the books.  His actions make perfect sense for a little boy.  In the show he's supposed to be a couple years older, but obviously they increased that with the recasting last season and role as King.  As a teenager the inaction makes far less sense, and makes that a bad change for the show. If they're going to age him up, he should act more maturely too."
"Finale perhaps? Episode 8 might be too soon. And I think episode 9 will be devoted to Winterfell. Perhaps Brienne kills Stannis.

It just wouldn't be an odd-numbered season's episode 9 without a guy who we think is gonna deliver justice to the bad guys dying unexpectedly."
YES
It's pretty ridiculous in the show.
"Yeah, they did.

I agree with you on the second half of S3 being the point where Breaking Bad turned to gold. The first half on the other hand... let's just say that it contains my least favorite part of the entire show AKA the cousins."
I know right!
Other than two of the three biggest characters in the show meeting for the first time?
Something far worse... 
Selyse doesn't give a shit about her daughter. 
"The ""inquest"" was a farce.  Cersei unleashed a monster by resurrecting the Faith Militant,  and she may not be able to stop them."
Wouldn't surprise me.  I'm sure nothing Dinklage does on camera isn't planned in advance.   He BECOMES Tyrion Lannister.

Mag the mighty (Intelligent)

The Mountain (It would be cool to see him and Elendil fight)

"For the same reason they aren't introducing ""Aegon"", Jon Connington, Wyman Manderly, Euron, Victarion, Penny, Reznak, Arianne, Quentyn, etc. Because they want to simplify and finish the show in seven seasons."
Well I'll take your word for it &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;
"This may be a dumb question, but why do so many houses have Valyrian swords?"
You can't be serious right? xD
"Remember when Cersei said there were only two of that lion pendant, one on her and one on Myrcella?  An eagle-eyed user in this sub caught a still of Sansa in S1 or 2 wearing it.  It's the one Joffrey gave her.  Also, it showed up well before Ellaria could have sent it, since he had *just* tried asking Doran to do something and been rebuffed.  Which means Cersei faked the threat in order to send Jaime down there.  All he has to do is see that Myrcella is still wearing the lion pendant to realize that Cersei duped him.  That'll sour him on her.

I'm still holding out hope for LSH.  But to be honest there's still plenty of time to introduce her, even into next season depending on how much they cram in from the books.  I mean, they still haven't touched the Iron Islands; they could go well into season 6 on what they've got already."

"Also, the idea that Sansa is becoming a master plotter is just BS. She's a freaking amateur, and lying about Lysa's fate doesn't change that. Sansa's strength has always been her endurance.

It would be like people complaining about Ned's fate. ""Ned for once tried to plot and in return he was thrown into a cell. HBO is not allowing Ned to be developed into a strong manipulator. The writers clearly don't know how to write male characters."" Why are people who were fine with Ned's fate complaining about Sansa's rape?

"What do you mean by soft? Well groomed? Soft spoken? Weak physically? Littlefinger for instance, isn't macho, but I don't consider him feminine. As far as perfumed... I mean people with money can afford to be clean and smell nice.

Brienne exhibited masculine characteristics, I agree. What do you think of Loras? He's gay, but is he feminine? No.

I didn't know his ""little birds"" were mostly children, but how is that relevant here?

In modern society, I'd think men would be more interested in grown women. They tend to know what they are doing sexually, they can take care of themselves, and they don't play all these mind games so less bullshit. "
I didn't say he deserved anything. :(
For Sam's protection and he is going to the wildlings. Bringing a big dangerous wolf with him sound like a great plan?
It'll depend on Sansa. Sansa could divulge that Littlefinger killed Lysa and Joffrey and that he forged the Tyrell-Lannister alliance.
About 14 years ago. So it ended about 3 years before Robert was crowned.
"The War of the Five Kings did more damage to the Riverlands and Westerlands than all the wildlings could do in years of running around free.  For the sake of argument, assume the wildling army was truly 50K strong and the wall didn't exist, so they were all able to just move on through.  They don't have horses, most have little training, and they're traveling with wives and children, their old and their sick, without support from anywhere. There are no supply lines feeding their army as it moves.  Even striping every town they come across will still mean starvation if they don't break up and look for food and shelter separately.  And one they break into more manageable bands, the local garrisons can take care of them.  Ygritte was in awe at seeing the run-down holdfast structures south of The Wall; the wildings have no idea what a real keep or castle looks like, let alone how to attack one.  Sure they'll be hunting game in the woods and travel on roads would become more dangerous for a time, but they won't destroy any serious infrastructure, and over time they'll either have to assimilate or be killed.  

In contrast, by the time Robb made it through the Twins and started clashing with the Lannisters he had 24K troops.  The comments on the Lannisters Riverlands battles and Edmure's efforts to raise troops shows the Riverlands were fielding at least another 15K aroudn that time.  Tywin started gathering troops much earlier, which was why his army was larger.  References in the books put it at 35K; the show upped it to nearly 60K.  So that whole region has already been demolished by armies twice the size of all those wildlings.  They've already eaten through towns' supplies, killed plenty of locals, and burned crops to prevent resources falling into enemy hands.  And that's just the troops fighting in the Riverlands.  The Reach, Stannis, and Ironborn all had their fights as well.  The whole point of the title ""A Feast for Crows"" is all the ""vultures"" benefiting from the post-wars devastation.  

Read through [this thread](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/66106-house-army-numbers/) for examples of the hundreds of thousands of troops the rest of Westeros could potentially muster, and remember how many do have training, real weapons, and armor, let alone the local support.  The Red Wedding took Noble leadership from the North, crippling their ability to hold together a large army, but once they lost, thousands of troops made their way back to their homes.  Those thousands of experienced soldiers are the ones defending their people when any wildling groups attack.

&gt; hordes of wildling raiders would've been pillaging the whole of westeros.

That's the real myth.  They're rabble with too few numbers to ever cause real damage.  The Reach alone could easily take them with their numbers.  Dorne's and the Eyrie's armies are also both untouched.  Even if they made it to the Neck, they'd start to encounter foreign environment problems with flora they don't recognize.  Here's another [good old discussion](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/110802-the-true-power-of-the-wildlings/) on this topic.  

The difference with the White Walkers is they they don't need food, water, or rest.  They are an actual army with leadership, not just a collection of individuals sticking together only while it suits them.  Every person killed by a White Walker army adds to their forces, and they fear nothing.  That is a real threat to all of Westeros. That's the only danger to be concerned about for the rest of the story."

"We were talking Valyrian steel. I wasn't talking medieval times. 

Quality comes first, of course, but I do think that weight played a part. A lighter blade can mean more speed, effecting striking and parrying. Size of course, effecting mobility as well. Length can be nice for reach, but not as effective in close quarters.

If we're talking equal quality material and craftsmanship, I would go with a poleaxe or spear. Otherwise I'd go with a rapier and ring guard parry dagger.

Oh she knows.  It's not the first time he's made innuendos about her and Jaime.
Seems like their M.O.  They take characters we've already gotten used to and loaded them up with elements and roles that were taken by new characters in the books.  Helps give the favorites more screen time.
For the same reasons people used to think you could get AIDS from skin contact. People are afraid of diseases and don't really know how they spread. There is no germ theory in Westeros or Essos.

Sparrows flair has been requested before, but very rarely.  Warrior's Sons (just called the Faith Militant in the show) and Poor Fellows have more specific roles and have been requested more often, which is why they already have flair.

"There is no character named Arianne Sand. And I'm mainly thinking of the Sparrows, who arose out of the aftermath of the war due to septs being burned, septas being raped, etc. They are a very sympathetic group in the books, but in the show they're just crazy bloodthirsty zealots who hate gays and don't want people to have any fun."
"Ah, so it is! That helps, I think. But, sadly, those hands cannot belong to Edd, as at that moment he was busy dragging Slynt toward said block.

In A Feast for Crows they formed as a reaction to the horrors of war and only want to protect the faithful, the impoverished, the downtrodden, the oppressed, etc. They aren't bothered by prostitutes, gay people, drinking, people worshipping other gods, etc. They certainly don't carve stars into their foreheads or murder anybody."

I'm assuming that every interaction she has there is intentional.  For whatever psych-profile reason, whoever's in charge of her training program may have decided she needs to interact with someone also in training who seems to be ahead of her somewhat and mistreats her.

"For the most part, yes.  There have been many changes to simplify the story, and not all have been good, but some of the show changes were actual improvements (that GRRM's said he liked too).  I think the biggest issues lately have been sloppy writing, like the Unsullied forgetting how to fight together as a unit and the Sand Snakes acting like fools.  Thoughtful deviations from the books are fine, but a simplified show shouldn't be a dumbed-down show, and this season seems to have a greater share of that."
"Yeah, that's certainly true, so I suppose it was justified: repeatedly stabbed by a wight but not actually dead yet, then a quick mercy killing from his sister, then total destruction from a child of the forest to prevent his return as a wight himself. But damn, it does seem like overkill to watch. I haven't seen anyone this thoroughly killed since Lady Deathstrike in X2."
I don't get it... is the theory disproven now? Since they apparently need a new actor.
"I dislike Arya's Braavos arc, the Faceless Men and Book Jaqen, and even I can't deny that Tom Wlaschiha is awesome in the role and makes the character so much better than he is in the books."

If the show is doing it, then it's sure to be true in the books as well.  GRRM has the scope and time to craft a complicated red herring; D&amp;D don't.  If it weren't going to be true, they wouldn't waste time giving us more clues that point towards it.  And certainly not so many clues all at once.

"&gt; you could not see what the spoiler said for the green/red spoiler lines while you could see the black ones

That may be just an issue with legacy tags.  Some people still type spoiler tags with / rather than #, and it does not work well for touch screens.  If the tags you just happen to be testing are the / tags, they're not going to work as effectively on some readers.

Check the [mod post I mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/35obg5/mod_raven_a_reminder_of_the_rules_episode/) to see if the tag in the theory section works for you.  It's a standard green theory tag using #.  Those tags read normally on my Baconreader on Android. 

This subreddit still works with / tags for legacy support.  If you search the posts and want to read something from years back, it's good to maintain those old tags to still hide the spoilers.  But that allows some people to still use them today, resulting in tags that are not 100% consistent.  

&gt; when you click the link it redirects you to reddit.com in the in-app browser

That specifically sounds like you're trying to read a / spoiler tag and not a # one.   Redirecting you to the root home is technically what you should get when following a / href.  The same thing tends to happen with phone or tablet browser apps.  

The old ""tricks"" to get the / spoiler tag to still work on mobile was to either do a press-swipe motion, so it'll reveal on press, but the swipe would stop the load, or do a press, load the wrong/dead page, and then go back to the old page and for some apps the spoiler tag would show as active and visible then.

I've also used Dolphin, Firefox, and Chrome mobile browsers for Reddit, and I still use Chrome every day with it (it provides mod tools the reader apps don't).

I don't expect to ever see ADOS, and I don't know if her character will ever get payoff. But I do know that she's pretty boring and one-dimensional right now, and that shows no signs of changing.

"It's a question of maturity.  Ramsay has years or practice and knows how to torture mentally and physically without killing his victims.  Joffrey has not been given the time or freedom to develop his sadism, so while he can be extreme, he's also likely to kill his victims quickly, especially when he's become angry.  So is a quicker death better or worse?"

"No, of course not. It makes so sense in the show, as you can see, but in the books Varys is not a Dany supporter. He's trying to put Illyrio's son, a Blackfyre, on the throne."
"&gt; Why do you think he's not likely to be there?

Timing.  In the books Sam's on his way to Oldtown. In the show he's not even let yet, but next season's casting list suggests Sam will be making the same trip (though I'm guessing by land).  He's not there for Jon's death, and won't be there for the 999th's election.  The point of the Oldtown trip was to make his chain, which is supposed to take years.  Even if Sam just drops Gilly+baby off, runs to Oldtown, and ""omg I found this important thing to take back to the Wall"" back to Castle Black, he's going to miss most of the big events.  The Others should attack by then, and it's very likely the Wall will fail and even more of the Watch will be killed.  I don't see any way Sam's return is going to rally supporters who mostly don't know him to make him LC.  

Plus the direction of the show's plot makes it seem more likely Sam will have to leave before Jon gets back.  If that's the case he may just desert to save Gilly (and himself) from the other Watch.  There are a lot of red flags saying Sam's gone and won't be back.   At best Sam might return in the story's epilogue to become the Maester of the new, rebuilt Watch after all the fighting is done.

&gt; His Watch will have ended.

Not to him.  He's not looking for loopholes.  He's the hero looking to do what's right.  If winning the war means leading the Night's Watch to so it, he'll gladly re-accept leadership to get the job done.  He does not care about the Iron Throne, and he's not being set up to take over Winterfell.  That means his ""destiny"" is most likely the Wall with the Watch.  If he survives the big war he can rebuild the Watch and lead for X years into a period of safe stability.  He might just die anyway in the fighting, making the issue moot.

"Oh yes, you presented your perspective quite well, and in fact I agree with all of it. My central point was that Sansa is going through an ordeal not unlike what Daenerys went through at the beginning of the show, and I too hope that she can come out on top despite how terrible that ordeal will be. I feel quite confident that this is what is going to happen, as I simply cannot believe that we are simply seeing the showrunners continually hurting Sansa because it's fun for them. Nothing about what we are seeing happen to her right now is in any way good or alright, but I firmly believe that there will be payback and ladder-climbing once it's all over.

Six Feet Under is about a family that runs a funeral home in Los Angeles, which is where series creator Alan Ball calls ""the world capital of the denial of death"". Every character is realistically complex, each with strong personality traits often in direct opposition to each other. There's the sort of emo teen who's actually creative and unique (not so trendy as you'd think), the selfish older brother who conceals a soft spot for folks in need, the gay younger brother (played by a younger Michael C. Hall, aka TV's Dexter) hiding a wild streak behind a prim and proper exterior, and the mother who's trying to keep it all together and her family life normal and uneventful despite how tragically impossible that is given the crazy circumstances they all live under. I'd tell you more, including something crucial that defines a lot of what happens in the show, but is first episode spoilers that honestly is much better as a surprise. You've got it free to stream on Amazon Prime, so I highly recommend you go and watch the first episode and then let me know what you think. It really hits the ground running and is excellent throughout, getting still better and better each season, building up to what is universally acclaimed as quite possibly the best series finale ever aired on television. Great stuff, I promise you. If you like dramas and human stories, you will adore it.

Yeah, not everything is on Amazon Prime, but so much is on there that if you have broad tastes, it is well worth it (plus, free shipping on nearly everything?? Heck yeah!). I'm a sci-fi buff, and having access to all the Star Treks, the X-Files, the new Battlestar Galactica (an absolute MUST SEE), and much, much more makes it worth it alone, as far as I'm concerned.

I wouldn't say Adventure Time is anything like South Park; there is satire, but it's far more subtle. It really is a truly unique show. The closest thing on TV today I'd compare it to is probably Steven Universe (also a great cartoon) but even that doesn't come close. It truly does stand in a class by itself."
mhm.
"Personally I had a hard time keeping track of so many of the new late-game plot lines while also keeping track of the plot lines that had already been established.  Quentyn, Griff, the Sand Snakes, a whole pack of new Iron Islanders... my comprehension dropped somewhat because I wanted to hurry up and find out what happens to the characters I *already* cared about.  I realize not a lot of people had the problem I did (or it doesn't seem like it from what I'm hearing) but I imagine a lot more would have that problem in a TV format.  So trimming down the plot lines probably helps with that.

Remember: there can only be so many characters per scene.  There can only be so many scenes per episode.  And there are only ten episodes per season.  That's a fact that can't be wished away.  Something's gotta go."
You didn't spoil anything. No idea what they guy above is talking about.

"Yep, exactly.  

[more end-story heavy speculation, mainly books](#g ""Odds are by the end most of the old establishment characters will be dead.  The new King and Queen on the throne will likely be young, my guess is Sansa and Aegon (same age, she's ice and he's fire, the combination of bloodlines will reunite everyone, etc.).  The new KG will also likely not be experienced with leading, my guess is all the new heroes, like Brienne, Sandor, and Loras (and they're all maimed like Jaime).  Jaime was groomed to take over Casterly Rock and has more years of established battle experience than likely anyone surviving but Sandor, and Sandor was never a war leader.  Jaime can lead the new KG into becoming a legendary group like the old KG from before the Rebellion."")

[at least that's what I hope is being planned because](#g ""otherwise, what does that leave in the story?  I never expected Barristan Selmy to make it back to Westeros.  Tyrion should inherit Casterly Rock, and will probably end up Hand of the King too. He's also an essential adviser that would work well for the end (and likely to survive as GRRM's favorite).  The KG are supposed to be the best in the world, and the number of best-of people is pretty short.  GRRM said it'll be a bittersweet ending, which means sadness, but still satisfying.  It won't be satisfying unless there's some stable resolution to the main loose ends (like the Throne and KL)."")"

"It actually deals with the witch at the beginning of S5, known as Maggy the Frog in AFFC.   In the books she states:

&gt; Cersei: Will the king and I have children?
&gt; Maggy: Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you. 

Valonqar is High Valyrian for ""little brother,"" which is why Cersei feels so threatened by Tyrion.  But there's a prevailing [theory about what the prophecy means (heavy speculation for end of story)](#g ""that Jaime is the little brother, and he'll be the one who kills Cersei. Losing his hand is another way GRRM is trying to throw off Readers about him being the one.  Some people feel he'll end up hating her, but personally I think it'll be a mercy killing.  By that point in the story Cersei will have literally lost everything but Jaime, and she'll hate him for it all anyway.  She'll likely be broken if not crazy. So he'll strangle her, perhaps even at her request, to put her out of her misery."") And that's why I doubt Jaime will die any time soon.  

[Jaime end-story heavy speculation, some Kingsguard info](#g ""I also think Jaime's going to outright survive to lead the Kingsguard.  It's his arc to finally become a selfless, honorable knight, and he's got to serve on the KG to accomplish that redemption.  He's also the only one suitable to transition and really lead the next crop of KG for the Kind/Queen on the throne at the end.  I think the time with LSH will set him on that path.  He'll somehow convince her that he's truly changed, and that'll also free up Brienne too."")

So, you can imagine my horror when I thought that revelation meant she was pregnant during the dog hunt. Of course, this just means we've added another woman to his boring -&gt; dead list. Hardly an improvement."
"One example that comes to mind: GRRM himself has said that he wished he had thought of having the moon door be set in the floor in the middle of the central chamber of the Eyrie, rather than just being an ordinary door set into the wall. Way cooler."
"It would still have to be nullified by the High Septon or a Council of Faith, though."

"If they did that, would they not just get rushed from the sides? "
"I love Olenna, but Margaery and Loras are boring and often times annoying."
I didn't think so.
"King Aegon IV publicly bestowed the Targaryen sword of kings, Blackfyre, on his bastard Daemon Waters instead of his legitimate son, Daeron Targaryen. Some felt that the sword symbolized the monarchy, as it had been the blade of Aegon the Conqueror, so the gift was the seed from which the Blackfyre Rebellions grew.

Aegon IV legitimised all of his bastards on his deathbed. His noble bastards were called the Great Bastards, the most notable of whom was Daemon, a great warrior and wielder of the Targaryen Blackfyre. He took the name Daemon Blackfyre from the sword.

In 184 AC, Aegon IV was succeeded by Daeron II Targaryen. King Daeron was a cultured, scholarly man and reigned over a sophisticated court, attended by maesters and learned men, which was perceived as effete and overly-refined, not pleasing to many of his more martial courtiers and nobles. His marriage to the Dornish princess Myriah introduced foreign influences and manners to the court, further adding to the displeasure with his reign. In addition to the aggravation of the Dornish influences at court, popular rumours held that King Aegon IV's sister-wife Naerys had shared her affections with their other brother, Prince Aemon Targaryen, leading to the possibility that Daeron II was not the son of Aegon IV.

After more than a decade of building tension, the Blackfyre Rebellion finally broke out in 195 AC engulfing all of Westeros, the seeds of this rebellion were planted early on, but it took years for them to bear fruit. There was no final insult, no great wrong that led Daemon Blackfyre to declare a war against Daeron. If it truly was love for Daenerys as some whisper why did Daemon wait eight years before rebelling. Especially since his wife Rohanne of Tyrosh had already given him seven sons and a daughter, while Daenerys had already had several children by Prince Maron.

In truth the war broke out because the seeds had found fertile ground because of Aegon the Unworthy. Aegon hated the Dornish and many Lords and Houses who spent centuries at war with the Dorne longed for the return of those days. Many great warriors looked on dismay on a realm no longer at war and did not like a peaceful, scholarly king who filled the court with learned men, Septons, Dornish and women. They looked at Daemon and saw a Warrior. Many lords and knights with grievances against the Iron Throne soon sought Daemon out.

Other factors was Daemons growing resentment at having the status of a bastard, and what it meant. Another was that he gained councillors who urged him to it. Daeron sent the Kingsguard to arrest him, but Daemon escaped with the aid of Ser Quentyn Ball, the master-at-arms of the Red Keep."
"Even on the show, she is RESISTANT, not IMMUNE."
"Exactly. Too soon D&amp;D, too soon.

What's the rush? They could go 8 or 9 season's, but they are fastforwarding to make 7. I'm sure there's more then enough material in the books yet to be written/published."
Most likely wll be something different.
"She says right at the very beginning of the scene that Doran wanted to ease his concerns over her safety and treatment.

Remember, Doran, the guy who runs things there, is the one who *doesn't* want to start a war with the Lannisters.  Jaime is going to be just fine.  And it's not like he thinks Jaime wants to hurt Myrcella."
"I watch in good quality and never had this problem. Some scenes are meant to be dark, but pitch black never. I can see everything fine and could count the amount of stones in a wall."
"Wow, so they were. Thanks! Man, it's amazing what you don't notice when you haven't trained yourself to recognize an actor yet..."
"Also, it's not like there's a law forcing production companies to submit accurate cast information to IMDB in advance.  And they have no incentive to post spoilers for their own show."
"Oh yeah, totally! It was the second most exciting scene in that book, after [ADWD](#b ""a certain thing that happens in the fighting pits"")."

There are some real gritty moments in the show, and some very real explorations of the nature of grief and loss that truly hit home for anyone who has ever lost someone they love. And plenty of great human drama first and foremost.

Yeah, I tend to get into recommended shows and binge watch them, analyze, rewatch, then finally move on to the next thing. I love getting completely absorbed into an engrossing fictional world. It's a diversion like no other. Six Feet Under, Breaking Bad, and Game of Thrones are among the best in that regard. The Walking Dead is a different beast entirely: an interesting concept with some compelling characters (but they could be better), but not always so well executed. I keep up with it, but it's definitely in a different tier than the truly great dramas. I'd put Vikings in that category as well, though there are times it is very Game of Thrones-esque and totally badass. I'd recommend checking out that one as well, but yeah, no Game of Thrones."

"Yes, but probably some big death(s) ;D"
"And he started the series as a bastard. Also, Littlefinger used Lysa's family name to become the acting lord of the Vale."
"Well, the North, maybe.  It's doubtful the wildlings would head south and take over all of Westeros.  Until it's known exactly what the White Walkers are going to do there's also no way to know even how important The Wall really is to ""saving the realm.""  Maybe they just want to sit down and have some tea."
Looks awesome. Great job!

"I am feeling the same way. However I loved how shit got down for her last episode, but I like her more as 'queen'. "

"Only because she had a wealthy and influential father who stopped at nothing to find a maester to help.

Episode 10 will be packed as it is. Will there be enough time for a clash between Stannis and the Boltons?
"Hmm...

Martell? Pycelle? ...Olenna!?"
I like your take on the matter.
"Tyrion's definitely getting to Meereen, from what we've seen in trailers."
Littlefinger's.
There are always supposed to be 7 of them.  Just because the show hasn't shown each individual appointment doesn't mean they aren't being replaced as necessary.
"I don't think they did show that, but it would be more then normal that they get paid. Oberyn hadn't a reason to get paid, because he probably didn't need money and came to kill the Mountain. But would you give your life for a thief? For nothing? Don't see that happening."
"And promptly get himself and his mother killed.

"I don't understand why Olyvar was so smug during that hearing. Won't the Faith Militant come after him for being gay as well? Did they grant him immunity or something? It hardly seems holy to grant exceptions to anyone. Unless his sins have been forgiven for his cooperation in doing the gods' work. But then he'll have to promise to be a good boy from now on, which doesn't seem likely."
"It's hard to truly dislike Jorah because all of his worst flaws, as bad as they are, are a lot like things I've done in the past too.  He's just *really* bad about women.  He gets overly hung up on women he shouldn't try to be with, and then he makes incredibly stupid choices to try to get or keep them.  We've all done those sorts of things in our own past relationships, although most of us get over that level of stupid well before we get to his age.

Other than that (which is impossibly to truly dislike him for) he's an all-around great character."
It's his wedding night.  You think Ramsay is *not* going to get it in on his wedding night?
I didn't realize she keeps her dragons between her legs
When capitalized like that I imagined WEEP being VEEP but a drama.
"It's this or ""Kill the Boy""."
"There's only about 1 season's worth of material for a Dunk &amp; Egg show.  However, it lends itself to episodic content really well, so they could add a lot of one-off adventures and then use the adapted material for season finales and long-arc overlays."
"I actually thought he already had flair, but I see that's not the case.  Looks like he somehow slipped through the cracks in a previous update, because I know he was in the list to be added.  He'll definitely be in the next set."
I'd fund a Kickstarter to get Pedro Pascale to film this scene.
Lets fund that bad porno.
Is she kills Jorah I am done xD He can't die! Hopefully Tyrion will do some good words!
... what are they supposed to do. 
"I don't know the whole story yet, but in the books I have read Stannis is way more a 'person'. I love him in the show, but he is just kind of different in the books to me. And he is nicer in the books. In book 3 (maybe it was in the end of 2?) Stannis did go to the wall. Like he did in the show, but in the show it is just so rushed. He comes in the woods, is in Castle Black and now he is on his way to Winterfell. And Renly's death was different in the books. Can't really remember that, but in the show he is sending Melisandre with Davos to him and that was definitely not the case in the books. He still had something to do with it, but just not like that. Hopefully someone can fill me in on that... And also his 'sexual' needs like last episode where he touches her body. That is not the Stannis I know from the books.

And next to that I loved the Davos story after the Blackwater which I don't really remember in the show so probably that got skipped. "

He may have no patience for Cersei's foolishness, but one she is out of the way he would return for duty's sake. I suspect that if they had wanted to just write Kevan out of the show, they wouldn't have even bothered showing him at all this season. I doubt very much that many show watchers would have wondered where he had gone."

"Unfortunately, Jeyne Poole is so much less impactful to the show audience because they don't have time to sit down and think about who she is. "
Yup. The writing has tanked since they've started trying to do their own thing instead of adapting the storylines from the books.
"Because if the books end with everyone truly just dying, the bad guys win, that's it and too bad, most fans will hate it.  GRRM's writing more realistic fiction, but it's still fiction.  He's always written stories for people to be entertained.   He said the ending will be *bittersweet* not bitter.  There will be some good in it, and even if not everyone is happy about it, the story ending will be satisfying.  "

I can't believe that guy got downvoted into negatives for suggesting that supporting his family, as much as it pained him, was a valid choice. We all love the Starks, but choosing one's family, even if they aren't all nice, isn't an invalid choice.

And Theon was taken because Balon declared independence from the Iron Throne, the same thing Robb did later."

In the show that was pretty clear and even in de books it is too. I can't speak about Cersei rape in the books, because only read the first 3 and can't remember if that happend. She got raped and it was a pretty shit scene. In the good way, I wanted Theon to snap. He just had to jump on that prick, but he didn't. And you heard Sansa what sounded pretty fucked up.

Those woman should be called back to the show and a real fan would need to tell them what really happend in the books. I hope they don't make future decisions based on all this crying people. Just keep the rape as brutal, or even worse. This is Game of Thrones. Nobody makes you watch it, but it is a show about murder and rape is a big part of the world George created."

Maybe.

You could probably say that the law requiring them to consummate the marriage (which she agreed upon) is coercion. 

I don't agree. I think she could have said no. This is Sansa we're talking about. Even after she had seen Theon, she was still pushing her limits. She always has, even with Joffrey. 

&gt;Just because she may or may not have known that Ramsey was going to rape her does not mean that it isn't rape.

What? She knew they were going to have sex. You're saying that it would have been rape even if he hadn't told Theon to stay. Which is not right, because she was already taking her clothes off."

Blackwater is my favorite episode of the whole show, Theon is my second favorite character and his arc was done perfectly and Tyrion as Hand was great. However, Season 2 still had stuff like Robb and Talisa and Dany's Qarth arc. And there are only two episodes in Season 2 that I truly love."

"Gods, I can't wait to see the Queen of Thorns again. She is the best secondary character in the show, hands down."
"I agree completely about the squire flaw in the birthmark comment, but keep in mind that Olyvar was Loras' squire only because he was spying for Littlefinger.  For the entire show everything we've seen Olyvar do was clearly for Littlefinger up until this scene with the trial.  And now Littlefinger is back in town suddenly at the same time Olyvar becomes a star witness?  There's at least the suggestion of more happening behind the scenes with Littlefinger's involvement to escalate the conflict between Cersei and the Tyrells.   I assumed Olyvar provided a detailed testimony with LF's coaching before the trial that convinced the High Sparrow without a doubt, which was why he set up Margerary to test her before bringing Olyvar out.  "
Why would she think that?  Sansa vanished from KL during Jpffrey's wedding while LF was half a continent away (as far as anyone knew).

"If you ask me, the only real drop in quality the show's had was Season 2. After that it has just been going up.

This season is pretty similar to Season 3. 

- King's Landing is not the most important location
 
- We have a new fan favorite who most people didn't like in previous seasons
 
- One storyline is somewhat build around Sansa's wedding

- Tyrion is not the central character of the season

- Jon Snow has to work with a new faction of people

- One or two storylines will (presumably) have epic and shocking conclusions

In fact, what they should have emphasized was that Robb didn't tell him the plan. Edmure was Lord of the Riverlands and was protecting his Riverlands because Robb didn't tell him about the trap. He saw an opportunity to fight off Tywin, and he took it."
That isn't going to be in this season.
"I don't think the show is really getting into keeping track of who all of the Kingsguard are at any given moment.  There are 7 of them (including Jaime and Trant), they're top-level knights appointed as necessary, and that's all the show needs to keep track of."

"&gt;  Jon is being set up to take over Winterfell

I think the writing on the wall points more to Rickon for that.  He's the ""shaggy dog"" in the story. The only reason for his existence at all in the story is to show up at the end, and the only thing that'd be left for him to do is take over Winterfell as the last surviving Stark (who's not doing something else).  And if Rickon's doing that, then there's nothing left for Jon to do.  I agree if the 1,000th election is held after the battles are all done, there's an opportunity for Sam to be back and get elected by the remnants of the Watch, especially if he somehow distinguishes himself in the battle, but for that to happen Jon would have also died in the battle. 

&gt; Robb already legitimized him. That means he has a stronger claim than any of his siblings.

So did Stannis essentially, and that was a stronger offer.  Jon didn't need Rob's letter to establish that, and since Rob was also an upstart King not acknowledged by the Iron Throne, the only people who would care about Rob's word on that are other Northerners.  Jon's legitimacy would need to be established by the Iron throne to hold for the rest of Westeros.  The importance of Stark legitimacy then seems to relate back to Jon being a rallying point for the final battle. The Northerners who know of Rob's letter will follow Jon as a Stark.

No. Again, read my previous comments. I say that she is being raped, night after night. I'm just not so sure that the what we saw on her wedding night was rape. You know, that scene that caused people to quit watching the show?

So why people would read it like this? I don't know it is a lot more work while you basicly can enjoy the book. Just go read first AFFC and then go on with the books ;P"

"GRRM is a mature writer with a lifetime of experience writing for both publication and TV.  ASOIAF is a groundbreaking work with a modern, gritty realism that's gotten GRRM labeled the ""American Tolkien.""  ASOIAF has greatly influenced Fantasy over the last decade with many writers adopting models employed in the books.

Paolini is a very young writer who was able to get Eragon published by a combination of extreme persistence and pure luck.  As a teenage writer he's marketable as more unique, and as a person he's a likable guy who does well with personal appearances.  That combined with his ability to actually finish books got his series published, but that doesn't make Inheritance a quality piece of work.  It's very derivative (some have called it plagiarism), and the characters and story are not really developed past the established references he pulled from. 

There's honestly no fair comparison to make between the series.  ASOIAF is a quality piece of work, and even so it took years before it became famous+mainstreamed.  Paolini was just lucky, and hopefully he'll keep at it and produce much better works in a few years.  "

They don't hate gay people, they don't care about drinking, they never kill anybody, they don't care if you worship different gods than them, they don't try to shut down any brothels, they don't carve things into their foreheads, etc. All they want is to help the poor, speak out against the corrupt, and protect the weak from oppression and the horrors of a war-torn country.

Varys said it best when he said LF would rather burn the world to the ground and be king of the ashes.

Wait wasn't that implied? She did it soon after Marge taunted her.
"True. We lose contact with Theon in the books towards the end of Book 2, and we find him again in Book 5, and at first we don't even know whose POV we're reading because he's changed so much, and then slowly over flashbacks we realize what happened to him. On the show, the period between the end of the second season and the current timeline has been a couple of years at least, so it's very likely."

"[Direwolf foreshadowing for Jon and Ghost WARNING HEAVY SPECULATION](#g ""So Jon is killed at the end of ADWD.  He'll warg into Ghost and stay there for a while, essentially becoming a ghost himself, haunting Castle Black without being able to speak, etc.  That time in Ghost seems certain because he was elected the 998th LC of the Night's Watch.  That's an awfully specific number.  I don't see any reason how it can mean anything but that while Jon is a ghost for a while, weeks or even months, some other LC will be elected.  After that everything falls apart as the White Walkers attack and kill lots of people including the LC.  Somehow after that (I assume Mel will be involved too) Jon will come back to life (reborn as Azor Ahai, the Lightbringer, etc.).  By then everyone will understand Jon was right about the wildlings and getting any help they can and/or the whole AA thing will make it obvious they should listen to him.

It's also why he is reborn as Azor Ahai to become the savior of mankind.  Somewhat by definition at this point in the story, all the other Targaryens are assumed to be dead, so Jon is a 'ghost' for that reason too.

The show doesn't use them a lot because it can be hard to work with animals and CGI is expensive.  In the books they're very important both as active characters doing things and as symbolic foreshadowing (like a lot of stuff in the books)

But they could still do LSH later on.  When you think about how much other material they're presenting, it's putting a lot of things off, perhaps into season 6.  This season is focusing on introducing a lot of new Dornish characters.  [AFFC](#b ""There are a lot of new Ironborn to introduce as well, and those may have to wait until season 6 so people aren't having too many new things thrown at them at once."")

"&gt; frustrating seeing how entitled some TV fans like to act. 

Yeah, it's a problem for some book fans too.  We want the subreddit to be as inclusive as possible, but there will always be selfish people wanting only their view.

&gt; yet this doesn't upset us.

You don't see all the complaints.  Getting that theory spoiled has upset many people.  That specific theory is why green theory tags were added to this subreddit originally.  The major book theories, including that one, are essentially future spoilers.  Even if they're not 100% true, it's obvious some things are right.  Some readers don't want to know theories; they just want to talk about about the books they've read as-is.  That's more common with recent readers, but in fairness it really doesn't matter.  Everyone ought to be able to discuss without spoiler danger.

&gt; it is not a spoiler because it is not verified; it is just plain old speculation.

See that's dangerous here.  As I said speculation is a spoiler here.  Granted that's not the case in other communities, but ""plain old speculation"" requires spoiler warnings just like canon events.

&gt; Please tell me you will be applying the same iron rule for spoilers/speculation next season when the show starts to overtake the books? 

The spoiler system here already covers that.  It really doesn't matter if the show provides book-story spoilers first or if the show goes off and finishes the story to be completely different than the books.  Show and book spoiler warnings are mutually exclusive.  Sharing the same event is a coincidence that's irrelevant in the eyes of a spoiler tag.  The system was designed to handle anything, and it still works fine for where the show's going now.

&gt; I fear a rather large exodus of subscribers if they are allowed free rein just because something has aired when it will still be a huge spoiler for book readers who've had to hold their tongues for the last 5 years.

People still can't mention Ned's death without warning.  Granted there are a lot of people posting spoilers without warning in general lately, and we're about to post a mod reminder about that, but all spoilers from the whole story are still moderated.  It doesn't matter what the show does."

Stannis is Robert's brother and has just restored House Stark, brought down House Bolton and is fighting against the Lannisters. Also as a bonus, he has a letter that proves that Ned supported him, and Yohn Royce seemingly was Ned's buddy. Why would they fight against him?

"Everyone reads and watches differently.  Many readers failed to pick up on Renly+Loras regardless of the many references.  The show's ""subtle allusions"" are often more glaringly obvious to readers than non-readers.  There's no reason to believe the clues about Jon are understood by non-readers yet.  There haven't been that many of them on the show.  Yes, some viewers have figured it out on their own, just as some readers figured it out on their own while *most readers who know about it now only learned about the Jon theories online*.  The rest of the people won't see the whole picture till it's revealed in the show and books, and they get it fully explained that way at the end.  And that's perfectly fine too."
Of course. Copper pennies and halfpennies are the smallest units of currency in the Seven Kingdoms. Pennies usually have the seven-pointed star on them. 
Try /r/earthoficeandfire for that.
"I know people are going to call him unprofessional and stuff, but I love it. You can see in every interview how much research and preparation he had done, and just how much he loved his character, even if he didn't have as much screen time as a the more popular characters. Salty, but with good cause."
"And he only has authority over Tarly soldiers, which include those that serve House Hunt, of course."
"Spread the word, darlin'. Stannis back."

I want his character to break for so long!
Totally. I was so proud of him at that moment. Best lawyer in the world.
"Yeah, I suspect that's more or less the idea."
I have seen him saying that too. And if that was the scene then that doesn't seems right to me. Just hyping it all up.

No. And that isn't exactly how greyscale is spread. It is a virus that spreads through bodily fluids and is also waterborne.
"The Sand Snakes have a lot of potential, if they can do more than stand around posturing like ""badass grrl"" stereotypes.

And Elaria is only mother to one of them.  They're all Oberyn's daughters by different mothers."
We've seen Dorne.
A man has already said.
"&gt; emperor of Nilfgaard

I'd like to be the emperor of Milfgaard."
I wonder if they will fix some of these scenes for the blu ray release.
"Please tag that last bit.  It's one of the major story theories, and this post does not have a [Theory] title warning."
"Maybe Sansa *won't* tell Littlefinger, to signify to the viewers that she's isn't under his control entirely."
"&gt;Loras having a relationship with Renly

No one's complaining about that, he said Loras having a relationship AFTER Renly, which some readers say goes against his character since he's still mourning Renly in the books."
Well that's your opinion. Personally I prefer the first 6 episodes of Season 5 to the first 6 episodes of seasons 2-4.
"How about Dany being at the fighting pit the same time Jorah is there? Or the Sand Snacks showing up in the water gardens at the same time as Bronn or Jaime. I mean, is this lazy writing or do they have no other choice due to time constraint."
"True.

I think it would've been better had she already slept with Littlefinger, then we could get behind her ""playing Ramsay"" but as it stands, she has been acting like KL Sansa, apart from the Bathtub scene with Myranda. Which was awesome btw."
There we go. I was thinking the same thing. I'm pretty sure Tommen's actor is only 17 at this point.
"The evidence of Littlefinger looking after her is even more so. Catelyn believes that Littlefinger betrayed Ned. How is Littlefinger exactly protecting her by giving her to the Boltons, and why isn't he there? How does Catelyn even know that Littlefinger is ""protecting"" her?"
Remember the boat times?
It's either foreshadowing or a red herring.  D&amp;D seem to be about 50/50 on those.  They want to keep us guessing.
"I started in season 1, when in episode 10, Joffrey is trying to make her cry by making her stare at her dead father's severed head, asking her to look at it, and she just goes like ""how long do I have to look?"" and Joffrey looks flustered at that."

"Yup. It's just a simple reaction, really."
"Despite the Unsullied's terrible tactics, B.S. went out like a true knight.  He cut motherfuckers DOWN!"
"It's all the people replaying the Bronn/Tyene scene, that's causing it. :p"
/r/thronescomics would also like that.
"Stannis dual wielding swords about to kill both Ramsay and Roose at the same time, and from behind Brienne stabs him, smirking, thinking she killed the bad guy in this battle. Then she goes and finds another Stark to reject her service."
( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)

"Man, I wish we'd had a scene between Oberyn and Olenna."
"Have you seen the review for episode 8 yet? The wildlings aren't like ""Hey Jonnie, let's be friends!"". So most likely there will be white walkers and they will fight together and become kind of mates. At least that is how I see it happening."
"We have yet to see any grumpkins or snarks in the show, so he might still be right about those."

He is such an amazing character in the books! 
"Okay, let's see. From what I read, Mereen is twice the size of Astapor. Braavos and Volantis are pretty much tied for first, though Braavos is now more powerful. Apparently Pentos and Lys are larger than Astapor. Like, quite a bit larger. And they should not be far behind Braavos/Volantis. So I'm going to place Mereen a bit behind Braavos and Volantis."
"Ooh yeah, I could definitely see that working."
The entire scene played like a medieval Charlie's Angels ripoff. Like a B-movie.
I want to see The Red Woman on a C-Note and Davos on a fiver.
You really must not understand what people are complaining about.

Rocking the best moustache on the show since Joffrey's wedding.
I think they literally did.
And his name is *Fast Food*.
"""Brutal"" because she was losing her virginity? It's possible that he was rough with her, but we don't actually see anything. We can presume it.

She's very clearly being raped now, but was she on her wedding night is the question. Also, if people are triggered by seeing rape, even if it's off screen, why do they watch a show like Game of Thrones?"
"It's from Mance.  He was was a wildling child taken by the Night's Watch (after his parents were killed) and raised as one of them.  The Watch gave him his name, so it seems to follow that that's their name for those North of the Wall.  there are plenty of other lowborn characters without any surname."
"Except for the other time they were mentioned, as cited in the comment you are replying to."
"And him becoming a maester. 

I mean, I didn't want to watch the scene, but it was there for a reason. Just like Ramsay/Sansa's wedding night."
"You know, that does make a lot of sense. I hope you're right!"
"- It might be the first time in the books where we see Jaime be fully in charge of the situation.

- The people Jaime needs to deal with and the ways he deals with them are interesting. These people include Lancel, the Mountain's men, the Freys, Edmure and the Blackfish.

- Jaime swore a vow to never fight against the Starks or Tullys to Catelyn, and he actually keeps it. This leads to Jaime having to use diplomacy, and he's actually surprisingly good at it.

- We meet Jaime's aunt Genna, who is like the Lannister version of Olenna. She also gives us new insight into Tywin's character.

- Some readers might have seen the Lannisters and their bannermen as the ""villains"" for the first three books, but Jaime's arc in the Riverlands really shows that most of the Westermen are really just decent folk.

- Jaime has been a great fighter for most of his life and has never cared about court intrigue, so it's great to see him find new things that he can excel at now that his hand is gone."

"&gt;GRRM says that they mainly kinda intersect in TWOW

Wel ha-ha-ha! At first I though you linked the wrong picture.
I think they're trying to avoid flooding the screen with too many faces at once.  They're basically taking turns with all the new characters that need to come in.  Dorne is up first.
"I think once he hit the mainland (fingers crossed), he'd probably seek out the Brotherhood without banners. Either that or he's set up someplace working as a blacksmith. Maybe in the same village where Hot Pie is at?"
He actually saved Bran and Robb's life in season 1. Right after Robb told him this wasn't his family.
"None of them. The books have just stopped being very relevant because the characters in the show are no longer following the paths that their counterparts in the books do. If you want to know the main characters that have diverged the most, however, it would be Jaime, Brienne, Melisandre, Tyrion, Sam, Barristan, Davos, and Sansa. "
And a bit of murder spread over it.

"Dudes can be ""raped"" too. Imagine being raped while you were drunk or passed out and you can't even tell anyone because it won't be taken seriously and you will get laughed at.

Yep this guy has a new background! I haven't seen this either how could I have missed this! My king my Jorah ;D Thank you very much for showing this it's wonderfull!
I'm fine with changes. I'm not fine with throwing out logic and retconning things within the series.
"Didn't really though about it like that, but some people here are like Dany and Tyrion are going to be the best mates. Maybe he will get to fly on a dragon, but that would be because he is small..."
Gave me gooseprickles too.
"Are you talking about posts on this subreddit or elsewhere?  Usually those posts are ok, so if they were removed here then there were likely issues with the comments.  "

"Yeah, no. Ramsay knows what the purpose of sex is."
"Dany currently has about 10,600 Unsullied (about 2,000 of which are still very young and have not completed their training). She also only has about 20 Dothraki warriors. She wouldn't stand a chance without dragons."

"1. Yes, Bran did.  I didn't say otherwise.  However, Jon only knew Bran was alive.  Bran and Rickon had already split up before Bran ran into Sam.  So Sam only knew about Bran, and told Jon.  Therefore: Jon didn't know about Rickon, just Bran.
2. In the show, Sam and Jon discussed where Bran could possibly find food and warmth within enough of a walk to survive, and they decided that he could only make it if he stopped off at Craster's.  That's why Jon volunteered to go there."
"Oh look to the sidebar, there's a button that says Edit Your Flair. Follow it."

"No, it works, I laughed."
"I think you are right, didn't think of it like that!"
He wasn't asking. He was doing that thing where they phrase an answer like a question.
"If it weren't for Cersei and all the other shit going on, Tommen would make a great king provided he still has Margaery as queen.

The Tyrells have been doing really well with Mace leading their house.  Mace is a sweet nice guy, not a mean bone in his body, seemingly way in over his head with all these ""vipers"" around him.  And he doesn't seem to even notice they exist.  Someone could cleverly insinuate to his face that they're going to rip his head off and shit down his neck and he'd be all like ""ho ho, what a witty jester you are!""  That's because he's lived his life surrounded by Tyrell women to take care of all the intrigue and backstabbing for him.  Tyrell men just take care of administration (occasionally war) and can just go on assuming that everybody gets along with everybody else, all the people love them, and every problem just works out by itself somehow.  Because the ladies make sure it works out that way whenever the men aren't looking.  Mace has had a great life, and his house has prospered enormously under his tenure.

I think Tommen would make an *excellent* king version of Mace, with Margaery around to take care of the intrigue and backstabbing behind the scenes.  He's a genuinely nice guy who to be honest would rather not know certain things and wouldn't look too closely under rocks that should be left unturned.  That system has worked extremely well in the Reach, I don't see why it wouldn't benefit the Crown just as much.

Unfortunately, all that other shit *is* going on.  Cersei is preventing Tommen from getting set up with a situation that would be perfect for him.  Stannis, Dany, and the Martells are out there.  So sadly he's never going to get a chance to become the Tyrell-style king that he's perfectly suited to be."
"Yeah, that's probably all information she's given in speeches to the crowds there, if nothing else."
Season 5 is good.
"No. A crowned stag was the sigil of the Durrandons, the Storm Kings."
"More - Hannibal, Banshee, The Walking Dead, Fargo, Sherlock, Outlander, Justified, True Detective, The Blacklist."
I'm pretty sure that Roose won't allow that.
"Yeah it reminds me of his fight scene in season 1, where the whole season the Dothraki warriors are doubtful of his armor since they claim it slows him down, and at the end of the season he uses his armor effectively to defeat one of Drogo's bloodriders. A true Westerosi knight that one.

Edit:

"Jorah is a good man, I hope he will get some respect from his cruch before his time is over ;("

"God, I wish they'd go back to the old Small Council chamber. I can see the point in Cersei holding meetings in the Tower of the Hand, because she's a Tywin wannabe and all that, but man..."
"Oh gods, medieval biological warfare... Terrifying."
"The story begins with a mystery about the identity of Jon Snow's mother.  Trying to figure that one out has led to a variety of theories.  The books provide many clues, and there's actually a list of origin candidates.  That said there is one ""main"" theory about Jon that seems more likely than the others.

&gt; Theories are spoilers too? 

Yes, all major/established theories are spoilers because the majority of them are well supported and likely true.   

Extensive speculation with details about any subject should also carry a theory warning to be safe.  For example mild/idle speculation like ""I think Hodor will win the Iron Throne"" doesn't require a theory warning, but if someone were to lay out their detailed speculation about all the events that lead to Hodor winning the Iron Throne, then that theory would need warning.

"I should have known it was Theon, since that's where he lives in the books as well as the show, but for some reason I too thought they were gonna change things and make it so that the Boltons had somehow captured Nymeria.

I know it's stupid, but the main reason for me thinking that way was that I had once had a dream that with Arya being in Braavos, Sansa would find Nymeria and they would bond, and she would be her wolf. I dreamed that the North rallied behind Sansa Stark and while Sansa wouldn't actually fight in the battle, she would be in the camp before the battle riding on her horse, with Nymeria running along her, inspiring the troops that fought for her."
"Yeah, but it still wouldn't make sense.

What I read elsewhere was that bringing Ghost to negotiate peace with sworn enemies is a really stupid thing to do."
"Oh, right, when Dany is asking Grey Worm why an Unsullied would visit a brothel for companionship. But that scene has already happened on the show, and he just said ""I don't know."" I wonder why they left that line out? It is a good one."
Nope. The show has forgotten she existed.

"Storm's End has thicker walls than Harrenhall.

But Harrenhall has an enormous amount of downsides.  For one thing, it's way too big to be supported by the lands and population around it.  It's impossible to mount enough soldiers to properly defend the entirety of it, at least not without it being a massive drain on your money and resources.  As a result, most people who've been in it only use part of it and leave the rest unmanned and empty.  That's where the rumors of ghosts come in.  There's a long and unlucky history of people who've controlled Harrenhall (probably all coincidence), and a whole lot of creepy rumors about it among the smallfolk.  To the nobility it's considered a burden, and tends to act as a  ""white elephant"" that gets passed around repeatedly by royal decree before being given up on, reverting to the crown, and then passed around again.  That's why Baelish was able to get it on the cheap.  But he didn't really want the castle, just the title attached to it."

"Both shows share a few of the same actors (Rose Leslie and Iain Glen come to mind pretty easily), and both deal with the politics and privilege of upperclass nobles and the regular people who serve them.

"The days/weeks/months time system GRRM uses is essentially the same as the normal world.

"A nitpick:

Theon is a ward, which is more than just a hostage.  Remember, Ned and Robert were wards to Jon Arryn.  Littlefinger was a ward to House Tully.  None of those were for ""hostage"" purposes.  While the ""hostage"" advantage does apply in Theon's case, the main point is to form lifelong friendships for the next generation, an ""old boy's network"" as it were.  

Robb and Theon were very close; if everything had gone according to plan, there would have been a lasting friendship forged between the future Lords of Winterfell and Pyke that would last at least for the next generation, if not longer.  It was a very long-term strategy to forge a lasting peace with the Iron Islands."
